0,Dragodar,"Intro:Welcome to the IC (In Character) Thread for your new adventure, The Storm on the Horizon.Let me start by introducing our party:Nightwing32193 will be playing Gideon, the Human Barbarian. (""#FF0000"")RealZachKraus will be playing Chadwick, the Human Paladin. (""#0000FF"")Graehamkracker will be playing Bendron, the Dwarf Fighter. (""#8E5500"")Beefychickens will be playing Demryon, the Elf Ranger. (""#800080"")ButcherDawg will be playing Seamus, the Half-Elf Druid. (""#008000"")If you have any questions regarding the rules or game mechanics, or about how to use the website or how to post, ask them here on the OoC ThreadWhen last we left our rag tag band of adventurers, they had just defeated the ominous denizens of what seemed to be some kind of underground cultist temple. They faced a fearful enemy with unfamiliar psychological powers, but emerged victorious. Their brief companion, Jimothy the Warlock, chose to take a different route when escaping the flooding tunnels. Whether he made it out of the cave system or not, the party has no way of knowing.The powerful storms that wrack the coast have been pummeling the countryside for hours now, and the cave system was beginning to flood. The group managed to find their way out of the tunnels, and they have just arrived in a relatively dry cave with an entrance almost completely concealed by shrubbery foliage. For now, they are safe.Gideon and Chadwick are at work getting a small fire started, and converse in low murmurs of their past exploits. Bendron and Demryon seem uncertain of each other, but for the moment have no choice but to trust one another. They busy themselves with finding dry material for the fire from amongst the vegetation in the cave.The sound of thunder and rain are still deafening outside the cave, but for now our party is mostly dry and mostly warm. The smell of petrichor is heavy in the air, and the curtain of foliage at the mouth of the cave drips with long awaited rainwater. Every few seconds a brilliant flash of lightning can be seen outside the shelter, quickly followed by a tremendous crack of thunder. The loudness of the wind does not subside, making it difficult to hear normal conversation.It is late at night on Friday, Iru 5th."
1,Graehamkracker,"Bendron finishes collecting firewood, adds it to the pile, then sits with his back against the wall, so he can watch is new companions. ""We always thought that these storms would end sometime. Guess it's not that time yet... Who are the powers in these parts nowadays? And how long has it been since the storms started?"""
2,Nightwing32193,"Gideon stirs the fire and looks around at the rag tag group of adventurers. He smiles at Chadwick as he addresses the rest of the party, ""So I suppose through battle we are all aquainted, and that's a start, for myself anyways. What are your plans? Waiting out the storm? Or would you like to explore these caves further, in search of more monsters?"""
3,Graehamkracker,"""I have no where to go. These caves were home, but it seems like I have been asleep for a very long time, as everything is gone and you all found a way in. At least until I can discover what has become of the rest of my clan, I seem to be best served by remaining with you folk to get my bearings, if you'll have me, and answer some of my questions about the world as it is now."""
4,Dragodar,"The motley crew of adventurers moves closer to the newly ignited fire in the middle of the cave. They huddle close for warmth as the howling wind pummels the outside of their shelter. The soft crackle of the twigs in the fire is a comforting sound against the crash of thunder, and the faint smell of burning tinder warms the hearts of the companions gathered around it.Suddenly, the curtain of foliage shielding them from the elements rustles and shifts, and the adventurers see an unsettling sight. A huge wolf, soaking wet and holding a small dead mammal in its mouth, plods into the cave. It looks up at the group and stands very still, only its eyes moving as they dart to and fro from one adventurer to another. It makes no move to turn back to the storm outside, but also makes no advance toward the group. It holds its kill in its mouth and watches intently."
5,Graehamkracker,"Bendron takes a defensive stance, putting hand to halberd and tapping the butt to the cave floor to draw the beast's attention. He inspects the newcomer, hoping to tell if it is natural or unnatural, friend or foe. ""Anyone else hungry?"" he asks the group, eyeing the wolf's kill."
6,Dragodar,"The wolf's ears perk up at the sound of Bendron's halberd clicking on the stone ground, and it turns toward him as it's tail goes up in the air and sways from side to side. It takes two hesitant steps toward Bendron before pausing again to glance around the cave. It's tail continues to swing back and forth like an upside down pendulum."
7,RealZachKraus,"Chadwick steps up aggressively, ""I could eat."""
8,Graehamkracker,"""The wolf, or his rabbit?"""
9,Dragodar,"The wolf takes another hesitant step toward the fire and drops the rabbit on the ground. It looks up at Chadwick, then at Bendron, its tongue hanging slightly out of its mouth as it pants gently and wags its tail. It bends down and nudges the rabbit toward the group with its snout.The wolf takes a step back and then pushes its paws out in front of it and its rump in the air. It puts its snout between its forelegs and wags its tail slightly, then stands up and lets out a short bark."
10,Graehamkracker,"""Probably just the rabbit then"" Bendron answers his own question as he slowly reaches for the meager feast, watching The wolf for any reactions"
11,RealZachKraus,"Chadwick eyes the wolf uneasily. ""What kind of wolf gives up a kill? And in these storms? I smell shenanigans.""He peers out of the cave, checking for a sign of what brought the beast to their location."
12,Dragodar,"The wolf watches Bendron closely. As soon as the dwarf grasps the rabbit, the wolf spins around and darts out of the cave. Chadwick follows the creature to the mouth of the cave and peers out after it. The wolf has already disappeared into the night without a trace, but while standing near the entrance, Chadwick notices that the storm seems to be letting up, just barely. It is still violently raining and there are still brilliant flashes of lightning, but the thunder seems slightly further away, and the delay between lightning and thunder tells the paladin that perhaps the storm is redirecting its fury away from their location."
13,Graehamkracker,"""Huh. Weird."" the dwarf says, and leaves his pondering at that. He preps a small spot and the rabbit for roasting."
14,RealZachKraus,"Chad strains his eyes through the rain, trying to find the rest of the pack. ""You think the poor bastard got lost?"""
15,Graehamkracker,"""I thought you paladins were supposed to believe in a higher power's intercession ."""
16,RealZachKraus,"""I believe there's no such thing as a free lunch, half-man,"" Chadwick spat, not taking his eyes off the surrounding forest."
17,Dragodar,"The savory fragrance of the rabbit meat over the fire causes the party's stomachs to grumble. What little fat was on the wild hare drips into the fire, sizzling beautifully and releasing a delectable smell. Soon, the rabbit is fully cooked, and Bendron pulls the skewer from over the fire. All eight eyes in the cave stare longingly at it, and everyone is thinking the same thing.Just as the realization that one rabbit will not be nearly enough for all of them settles upon the group, the foliage is brushed aside and the same wolf enters the cave yet again. To everyone's puzzlement but also delight, it has another rabbit in its mouth this time. It trots fearlessly up to the fire and drops the carcass next to the flames. The wolf lets out another short little bark and then scurries away, leaving the party yet again."
18,Graehamkracker,"""Or our new friend is offering us something for his safety"""
19,Nightwing32193,"Gideon grabs some of the cooked rabbit and whistles after the wolf, attempting to get the beast's attention."
20,Dragodar,"After several minutes, the wolf does not return, and the party eats the rabbits in relative silence. The storm sounds significantly quieter now, though not quite gone completely. As the party finishes cleaning the meat off the rabbit bones, the foliage parts yet again, and the wolf trots inside, as wet as ever and panting slightly. This time though, there is another visitor. Behind the wolf, a small, lean humanoid figure brushes aside the curtain of plantlife and enters the cave, as dripping wet as the wolf that preceded him. Standing before the party is young boy, between the ages of 12 and 15, with curly golden locks that cascade in a messy flow down to his shoulders. He shakes his head a few times, sending water spraying from his hair, and then looks up at everyone inside the cave with a smile. His eyes are piercing golden amber color, and his youthful face bears the sharp, angular features of elfin kind."
21,ButcherDawg,"""She is over-charitable. But I trust she has good reason. Are you here to escape the rain and the wet?"""
22,BeefyChickens,"Demryon laughs. ""The rain and the wet, I guess you could say that.""He tosses his last rabbit bone into the fire and eyes the newcomer curiously.""How old are you anyway, lad? And where did you manage to get a wolf for a pet? And why, oh WHY, are you wandering about in this accursed, hellish weather?"""
23,ButcherDawg,"He laughs softly, possibly condescending, ""Her name is Lou. And I must say she is not often this friendly to strangers. Nor is she mean, mind you. Just shy, usually. I do not know how long she has known me. She dragged me out of a fire when I was an even smaller boy. Six years old, I wager. But in that fire I lost my memory. In the six years since, I have been searching with her to find my people again."""
24,Graehamkracker,"""Hmph. Welcome to the club, kid. My people don't exist anymore. And I'm sure the rest of this lot have similar stories"" "
25,ButcherDawg,"A puzzled look flashes across his face as his head *****  (tilts suddenly by bend in neck) to one side. ""But I'm sorry to hear that about your people. And who might they be?"" He poses this last sentence to the whole group."
26,Graehamkracker,"""My clan is an ancient one - the Yundri. Before the storms - however long ago that was - we lived near the surface, trading with other clans and humans. We were prosperous and powerful. But the storms came and destroyed cities, drove us deeper underground, and sealed is in our tomb. I was born down there, some 1500 years after the Storms started, and after many attempts to find a way out, the clan elders chose some number of us to be put into a deep sleep, hopefully to awaken once the Storms had passed and remove the clan. But when I was awoken by these adventurers, I could find none of my clanmates, or even the long since forgotten remnants of our cities. I'm not sure if anyone else survived the sleep, and if they did, they must be long gone."" Bendron finishes and grows silent, suddenly feeling the whole weight of his plight."
27,Nightwing32193,"Gideon rolls his eyes at his two new companions ""Enough with the bloody sob stories for fooks sake. Come boy, take a seat. I'm Gideon, this is Chadwick, I honestly haven't taken the time to learn the rest of their names."""
28,Graehamkracker,"""I thought you three all knew each other already. Was that not the case?"""
29,RealZachKraus,"""How have you been, brother? It's been a minute."""

59,RealZachKraus,"""How have you been, brother? It's been a minute."""
60,Nightwing32193,"""If it pleases you sir, I'd rather not discuss personal matters in the company of folk such as this."" he nods at the others."
61,ButcherDawg,"The boy removes his pack from his shoulder, and lies beside Lou, using her back as a pillow as he awaits a story."
62,RealZachKraus,"Chadwick glances over at the fire, then back to Gideon. He lowers his voice, but still very audibly mutters, ""You mean the elf?"""
63,Nightwing32193,"Gideon looks at his former commander, then back at the fire, and says, quite audibly, ""Of course I mean the elf. And the boy who can apparently talk to wolves, dark magic that."""
64,RealZachKraus,"Chadwick swiveled swiftly towards the newest refugee, the merriment of joking with an old friend giving way to his original suspicion. ""But I suppose you conveniently don't remember that."""
65,Graehamkracker,"""Demryon here did just shoot me with an arrow, and he'd been given the benefit of a doubt before he showed us he deserved it."""
66,Dragodar,"The tension seems to be rising, as simultaneously the storm outside seems to be abating. Stormpeace is an ancient and unwritten law; it is only as strong as the storm is fierce. There are no set requirements for the observance of Stormpeace, and as the intensity of the storm outside fades, the pact between the cave's inhabitants weakens. If a diplomatic solution is not reached, the situation may quickly turn ugly for everyone involved. The wind continues to howl and rage, but the thunder seems less and less frequent. The rain is still violent, but not as torrential as before.It is late at night on Friday, Iru 5th, or early in the morning on Saturday, Iru 6th. You can't be quite sure."
67,Nightwing32193,"""And ya see that pretty gash across is belly? I have him that so I think your blood debt is paid, dwarf!"""
68,ButcherDawg,"""Have you had many adventures together?"" he asked the group, picking at a splinter in his palm."
69,Graehamkracker,"""It would be wise, boy, to at least try to answer some of our questions. But to answer yours: I just met these three. The big one and the paladin seem to get along, and no one quite knows or likes our friend the elf."""
70,BeefyChickens,"""...has no quarrels with any of you, I understand what went on down in that accursed crypt might prove otherwise... but the darkness that entered my mind... it was not me who flew that arrow."""
71,Nightwing32193,"Gideon springs from his seat drawing his shortsword, ""I've heard enough out of you half man! He is not my master! He is my brother born in battle! Something the likes of your people could never understand. Coward. We should have left you to sleep. Would have been for the better."""
72,Graehamkracker,"Bendron slowly rises in response, leaning on his halberd in an all-to easy stance. ""It seems that you know nothing of the likes of my people, and that you are too dense to learn. If I recall, we had each slain two of those beasts - seems like our skills may not be that disparate despite our different temperaments"""
73,ButcherDawg,"""My name is Seamus Olgaard. If you wish not to associate with me, just let me know. I have thicker skin than most. And I have never caught the cold."" "
74,Nightwing32193,"Gideon looks at the dwarf and let's out a long hearty laugh. ""Even if you'd have been worth my blade in your prime old man, seems that fate has brought us together. Let me be the first to extend my hand in peace."""
75,BeefyChickens,"Demryon quickly offers his hand ""Pleasure to make your acquaintance Seamus."""
76,Graehamkracker,"""Also, I'm Bendron. This one is Gideon, and the dozing paladin is Chadwick. You'll find no harm from us, so long as we none from you."""
77,Dragodar,"A somewhat stable peace seems to have been reached, and just in time. As the group tentatively shakes hands and makes introductions, the wind begins to die down. There is no lightning or thunder as far as the inhabitants of the cave can tell, but the rain continues to pour down, steadily and quietly. The storm, for now, has ended.The fire crackles with meager warmth as the new companions make each other's acquaintance. It is night time still, and everyone is tired from their ordeals.Being the only member of the party who has yet been outside the cave, you are the only one who happens to know that despite the thick curtain of foliage covering the opening, the light of the fire is visible through the vines and leaves in the dark of night. It is up to you if you share this information."
78,ButcherDawg,"""Are you planning to stay here for now? Lou and I were on our way to somewhere dryer."""
79,RealZachKraus,"""We came this way for...similar reasons."" He shrugs."
80,ButcherDawg,"""Perhaps then, we should venture out while the rain is at bay to find a new cave for shelter,""  little Seamus said looking worryingly outside."
81,Graehamkracker,"""I'm curious to see how the world is now"""
82,ButcherDawg,"""Surely, if such little things could find shelter from these terrible storms, it must be rather dry shelter."""
83,Graehamkracker,"""Rabbits dig their own homes, lad. I doubt we'd fit or be welcomed there. Mayhaps there's a town or some other refuge nearby?"""
84,Dragodar,"Listen to this as you read the following post and write your reply. linkSpotify linkAs the party debates their next course of action, a faint sound reaches their ears. At first, it is the far away sound of some kind of tribal drum. Then, the whispers begin. Soft but intensely foreboding, they send chills down the spines of the party. A slow chant takes form, growing steadily louder and faster. Terrifying ritualistic screams echo across the hills. The sound of an unholy pagan rite drowns the hills with its deeply unsettling cacophony. Maniacal female laughter rings out from several different locations outside of the cave. Through the curtain of foliage, it is difficult to pinpoint where any of the sounds are coming from, but it is apparent that the cave is surrounded by dozens if not hundreds of savages, of a tribe unknown.Screams of ecstacy mix with screams of agony as the discordant noise grows louder and more frantic. The party feels sheer terror as whatever depraved liturgy they're hearing takes place outside. Something truly evil is happening just outside their shelter.Though you cannot understand the tongue, you recognize the language as coming from a tribe of barbarians called the Niorû. They are known, even amongst barbarian tribes, as being the most savage and depraved of all savages. They worship Erythnul, the patron god of slaughter, war, chaos, depravity, and evil. Even other barbarians look upon them with fear and disgust. They are practicers of human sacrifice and are extraordinarily creative at coming up with the most vile forms of torture and murder.You feel your heart sink into you toes as you recall that the fire in the cave is visible from outside, despite the curtain of foliage.It is late at night on Friday, Iru 5th, or more likely early in the morning on Saturday, Iru 6th. Probably around 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning but you can't be sure."
85,ButcherDawg,"""This fire has clearly drawn others to this location. We are determined to find another town. If any of you wish to accompany us, you are welcome!"" Seamus makes a clicking noise with his mouth, and Lou responds by exiting the cave. Seamus follows her into the damp dawn."
86,Nightwing32193,"Gideon slowly gets to his feet. Readying his great sword. ""These savages are not to be toyed with. If you see them, kill them. They cannot be reasoned with. Pray to whatever fooking god you deem holy that they do not find us on this day."""
87,Graehamkracker,"""standard wedge, or something fancy?"""
88,Nightwing32193,"Gideon eyes his new dwarves ally and smiles, ""I admire you balls, half-man, but this is no trivial monster we face. On this day the entire nation will be out in search of blood sacrifice. If we are to live til sundown we must find a defensible area and hope their war parties pass us by."" He then ventures to the mouth of the cave and slowly peaks out, great sword at the ready, trying to get a better look at what's outside."
89,Graehamkracker,"""How far this land has fallen"" Bendron mutters under his breath, trying to remember if there were any defensible outposts in the caves nearby"
90,RealZachKraus,"B ""no offense, bud."""
91,ButcherDawg,Seamus looks at Lou for guidance.
92,Nightwing32193,"Gideon isn't paying attention to the trivial conversation of his party. His entire focus is on the chants and the war parties that have seemingly surrounded them. As he returns from the mouth of the cave he looks only slightly relived, ""They haven't found us yet.

93,ButcherDawg,"Seamus reads Lou's non-expression as her stubbornness to follow her own path in conflict with her stubbornness to not die. ""Fine. We will go with you all."""
94,Dragodar,"The fire burns brightly, illuminating the cave. As Gideon looks outside, he can he pinpoints of light throughout the hills, dozens of fires burning all around them. It is still dark outside, so sneaking through may not be out of the question, but it is difficult to tell how close dawn is. The fire burns brightly, illuminating the cave."
95,Graehamkracker,"Bendron gets up and gathers his supplies, using the halberd to bury the fire under dirt from the cave floor before joining the two near the entrance. ""How well do they do in the dark? Cause I can see fine and lead us out."""
96,Nightwing32193,"""We can't rely on darkness, that will hinder us just as much if not more so. And when the sun rises we will be outnumbered 100 to 1 at least. It is better for us to stay on the defensive and not try to engage them."""

98,Graehamkracker,"""I've been in this cave for thousands of years. It's time to leave. Follow me with hand on shoulder and we can slip between them in the dark, then head to the nearest town. I can see where they are now - there's enough time to act still."""

102,RealZachKraus,"""There's no glory in stupidity. I'd rather see what we're up against before we go to our deaths. We have the advantage now, let's use it,"" Chadwick whispers."
103,Nightwing32193,"Gideon shakes his head and shoulders his greatsword, ""If you all wish to attempt to sneak by them so be it. I still think we should stay in this cave until sundown of this coming day. But if it should come to battle remember, we will be shown no mercy, so show none to the enemy."""
104,ButcherDawg,"Seamus awaits at the mouth of the cave, looking back and forth to the others as the debate carries on. With a slight raise of both eyebrows, he slowly turns his head and a disbelieving stare away."
105,Graehamkracker,"""We either act now or hope that they can't find this cave - not a bet I'd like to make. I'm confident that we can avoid any large groups, and quickly dispatch any that may stumble upon us - if we keep the lad towards the middle we'll have eyes and steel on all edges. And then we're free to shelter somewhere safer and warmer and can figure affairs out there."""

107,ButcherDawg,"""Nothing. Sounds decided now. Chadwick?"""
108,RealZachKraus,"""We're not doing ourselves any favors by arguing. Lead the way, dwarf, you at least can see where we're going. Gideon, follow him and protect the boy. I'll bring up the rear in case we get ambushed. My magic should protect us for a little while if that happens."""

110,Nightwing32193,"Gideon scoffs,""Obviously."""
111,ButcherDawg,Seamus perfectly immitates Gideon's scoff and follows.
112,BeefyChickens,"Demryon glances in Seamus' direction, an eyebrow raised, then back to his front."
113,Dragodar,"The group prepares to exit the cave. Bendron takes Gideon's hand, who takes Seamus', who takes Demryon's, who takes Chadwick's, and the venture into the night. linkSpotify linkThe group heads out into the darkness, unable to see but trusting in the dwarf who leads them. Bendron carefully picks his way through the rocks and trees and underbrush, avoiding obstacles and whispering advice down the line about dips and bumps in their path. The party seems to be making good progress, but the chants and screeches all around them strike a chill into their very hearts. They are struck with a dark terror at the unholy sounds that surround them.Chadwick's Aura of courage makes him immune to fear effects and gives a +4 bonus to the rest of the party.(1d20+4)11(1d20+4)22(1d20+11)14(1d20+6)13"
114,Dragodar,"Bendron finds himself faltering. Newly awakened and grown unaccustomed to danger, the caterwauling of the savages brings flashbacks rushing into Bendron's mind. He finds himself distracted, and several times steps on twigs or kicks rocks that he otherwise could have avoided. The rest of the party is bolstered by Chadwick's powerful aura, but Bendron falls victim to the ice cold dread brought on by the evil rituals of the Niorû.Bendron is Shaken for the next ten rounds. The rest of the party is fine for now.Bendron continues to lead the party through the dark forest, avoiding the Niorû camps as best he can, but his progress is slowed by the terror that grips his heart. Sometimes he forgets to whisper advice about obstacles and someone down the line will trip or stumble, but for several minutes, all is well. Soon though, the party sees a small campfire directly ahead which Bendron seems not to notice."
115,RealZachKraus,"Chadwick hisses, ""what the hell is going on??"""
116,Nightwing32193,Gideon immediately makes an attempt to pull the dwarf in the underbrush and puts hand over the dwarf's mouth and attempts to keep him quiet.
117,Graehamkracker,"Bendron doesn't struggle, trusting that someone else saw something from behind"
118,RealZachKraus,"""Demryon, go see what's ahead,""Chadwick taps the elf on the shoulder."
119,ButcherDawg,"Seamus immediately turns to Demyron and nods as if to say ""I am going with you."""
120,BeefyChickens,"Surefooted,Demryon passes the others. His eyes focused on a distant flame. He only motions to Seamus to stay in place."
121,ButcherDawg,"Seamus looks at the others behind him and Demyron and gives them the exact same ""stay"" motion and proceeds to follow Demyron."
122,Dragodar,"The party stops and crouches low. The Niorû campfire is about twenty yards ahead.

Fortunately, neither is noticed. You see about half a dozen Niorû around the fire... mercilessly fighting each other to the death. Four dead Niorû lie on the ground around them. As the warriors battle each other, you can see and hear that they are laughing maniacally. These truly are a people of chaos and evil."
123,Nightwing32193,"Gideon still holding the dwarf by the mouth looks at Chadwick and and shrugs. ""Fock em."" he whispers."
124,BeefyChickens,"As Demryon approaches the encampment, his quiver now holds one less arrow. It now rests in his fingers and against the bent wood of his bow...ready to fly at a moments notice."
125,RealZachKraus,"Chadwick moves up to the front, straining his eyes for any sign of danger. He crouches next to Gideon, ""big bad dwarf itching to leave the cave, eh?"""
126,Graehamkracker,"""I'd rather do the finding than be found"" Bendron whispers back, shaking free of Gideon"
127,BeefyChickens,"Demryon turns back to his young tagalong and whispers, ""Be wary boy, needn't be hasty."""
128,Nightwing32193,"Gideon chuckles, ""With any luck I'll be able to take a few of these fockers teeth with me before their precious feast day ends."""
129,Graehamkracker,"""Men used to be civilized. Well, nearly. But these seem more beast. My aim is not glory for today - killing a few to say to more accomplishes nothing."""
130,ButcherDawg,"Seamus looks closely at the gathering by the fire, trying see what weapons they possess as well as other details."
131,Nightwing32193,"Gideon let's out a soft chuckle as he pats Bedron on the back, ""Why fight if not for glory, people will remember the name Gideon of the Ul Vadr long after I'm dead and burried, can you say the same friend?"""

135,RealZachKraus,"Chadwick tightens his armor and taps his axe to the ground. ""The lord'll sort em."" He grins, his teeth glowing in the dim firelight."
136,Dragodar,"The savages seem to be using primitive weapons. You see a scythe much like your own, a couple shortswords, a handaxe, a couple shortspears, and several offhand daggers.The rest of the party approaches the campfire and sees the same thing that Demryon and Seamus saw: about half a dozen Niorû with their weapons drawn... fighting each other to the death. Around them lay scattered the bodies of four dead Niorû. As the party watches from the shadows, the surviving savages swing blindly at each other with their weapons in a crazed frenzy, laughing maniacally as they do. One of the barbarians catches another on the jaw with his scythe and cleaves through the victim's head, dropping him instantly. At the sight of this, the other Niorû laugh hysterically and begin fighting each other with renewed vigor. The party watches in disgust as the savages cut each other down, growing more excited with every spurt of blood."
137,Graehamkracker,"""That's what, five left? That could be hard to do quietly"" Bendron whispers as he looks for a way around"
138,ButcherDawg,"Seamus raises his scythe and motions to the others, as if saying ""See what this scythe could do? Totally awesome."""
139,Nightwing32193,"Gideon raises his eye brows, as if finally starting to understand something,  ""So this must be what the Feast of Erythnul is all about. Just bloodshed? Well may as well help them celebrate their god.""  as he draws his great sword and charges at the nearest warrior, swinging his weapon in a great sweeping arc at the man's frame."
140,BeefyChickens,"""Hold on now, we don't know if it is just these few, there could be more beyond this camp. Why so eager?"""
141,ButcherDawg,"""I say we let sir Demyron let fly an arrow. Maybe he could land a deadly blow and leave the rest to come to us for an ambush,"" Seamus whispers in excitement. He has hungered for an adventure."
142,Graehamkracker,"Bendron sighs, then lowers his halberd and charges behind. He heads toward the middle of the group, halberd held low. He catches an ankle with the hook of his halberd and pulls, intending to topple his foe and follow up with a downward hack of the halberd's axe head.For touch attack, can use polearm for total +8 (1 to polearms, 3 Bab, 4 STR). For strength check, +8 (4 STR, 4 to trip) and +8 to follow up attack"
143,BeefyChickens,"Seeing how his other comrades are already charging head first into the bloody skirmish, Demryon looses an arrow in the direction of one of the unfortunate savages."
144,RealZachKraus,"Chadwick rolls his eyes, spits a curse, and hops into the clearing, bringing his great axe down at the left clavical of the nearest heathen garbage."
145,ButcherDawg,Seamus charges as well. Sliding through the grass and swinging his scythe to the back crease of a Niorû knee.
146,Dragodar,"Demryon releases his arrow, and the rest of the party charges into the small clearing. Upon seeing them, the Niorû's faces light up and they cry out in excitement, almost as if to greet the strangers. Raising their weapons, the Niorû charge blindly at the party.Lou, following Seamus, charges into the clearing and clamps her jaws down upon the arm of the shortspear wielding Niorû.(1d20+7)18(1d20+4)19(1d20+8)18(1d20+3)17(1d20+5)25(1d20+1)9(1d20)17Shortsword Niorû 1: (1d20)3Shortsword Niorû 2: (1d20)19Handaxe Niorû: (1d20)8Shortspear Niorû 1: (1d20)13Shortspear Niorû 2: (1d20)7Gideon: (1d20+3)18Seamus: (1d20+3)16Lou: (1d20+2)10Chadwick: (1d20+2)7Bendron: (1d20+3)19Demryon: (1d20+9)22"
147,Dragodar,"Gideon strikes the first of the savages holding a shortsword and Bendron attempts to trip the second, while Demryon's arrow strikes true on the savage with the handaxe and Lou sinks her teeth deep into a shortspear wielding savage's arm.

Shortsword Niorû 2 is now prone, lying on the ground and extra vulnerable to attack. He receives a -4 penalty to AC.Bendron gets a free attack on his prone opponent, for his successful trip.Demryon's arrow strikes the handaxe wielding savage in the chest and he stumbles, with a look of shock on his face. He is severely wounded, but his insane rage carries him forward as he raises his weapon once more. Lou draws blood, yanking on the Niorû's arm sharply; he cries out and nearly drops his spear. Chadwick, with a mighty roar, strikes the scythe wielding savage directly in the left clavicle, neatly separating the left side of his body from the right. For a moment, the body stands comically still, its eyes still moving, then the two sides fall apart from one another, the head attached to the right side, as a deluge of organs and blood soaks Chad's feet. The other Niorû pause to watch the grisly scene unfold, betraying fear in their wild expressions for the first time as they see their companion split seemingly easily from shoulder to crotch.Scythe Niorû is very dead.Everyone go ahead and make surprise round attacks, then we'll start the Initiative."
148,Nightwing32193,"Gideon let's out a maniacal laugh, ""Bring em home!"""
149,RealZachKraus,"Chadwick's eyes blaze gloriously. A feeling he had forgotten to miss washes over him as he echoes his warmate's laugh, ""LORD'LL SORT 'EM,"" he exclaims, giddily."
150,Dragodar,"Bendron swings his halberd down in a mighty arc, aiming for the neck of the Niorû on the ground.(1d20+8)23The other Niorû have had time to react at this point, and rush forward uttering loud warcries. linkSpotify link(1d10+6)14Bendron swings his halberd with fatal accuracy, cleanly severing the savage's head from his body. Blood spurts out of the arteries at a regular pace as the heart continues to beat, but soon the heart stops and the blood merely oozes from the neck stump in sickening mundanity. The fire begins to hiss as the collective flood of blood seeps into the coals. A foul stench fills the air as acrid black smoke billows up from the fire. The metallic smell of blood mixes with the putrid odor of the organs from Chadwick's halved Niorû carcass.The savages begin to ready themselves for battle, turning toward the party and readying their weapons.1) Demryon2) Bendron3) Shortspear Niorû 14) Gideon5) Handaxe Niorû6) Seamus7) Shortspear Niorû 28) Lou9) Chadwick"

153,Graehamkracker,"Bendron repositions himself between the nearest unharmed enemy and the group, using the momentum from his movement to drive the halberd like a spear into his foe."
154,Dragodar,"Bendron slices through the air with his halberd at one of the Niorû holding a spear.(1d20+8)17Damage: (1d10+6)7And the blade digs deep into the thigh of the savage, who cries out in pain.

160,Nightwing32193,"Gideon puts his sword through the wounded savages mouth then gets down on a knee and punches the dead man in the mouth with all his might, muttering something in his native tongue, then proceeds to extract the teeth from the corpse and pocketing them. Getting up he clutches his chest and leans on his sword. ""Either someone needs to kill him or we have to move NOW!"""
161,BeefyChickens,"Demryon locks his gaze on the fleeing Nioru. He looses an arrow, aimed at the back of his cowardly foe."

A half second later, Seamus' sphere of fire reaches the spot and hovers over the motionless body, illuminating it enough that the party can see that the Niorû is good and dead. Blood pours slowly from the place where the arrow is deeply embedded in the spine. The familiar ebb of adrenaline hits the party as they realize the savages are all dead. The clearing is a scene of absolute carnage; there is not an inch of ground in the clearing that isn't slippery with puddles of blood."
163,ButcherDawg,"Seamus hangs his head in disappointment. He failed to slay a foe. ""we need to get out of here now before more of those things come back!"""
164,Graehamkracker,"""All right then. Back on me, and lets get out of here."" Bendron heads towards the edge of camp, pointed away from the cave and back into the night."
165,RealZachKraus,"""Still defiling the dead, I see. Thought you would have grown out of that."" Chadwick walks over and lays his hands on Gideon's forehead. He does the same to Bendron.I suppose it's obvious but I healed him, 10 points to Gideon, 5 to Bendron."
166,Dragodar,"Chadwick approaches Gideon and wordlessly places his hands on the wound in Gideon's shoulder. A pale light briefly glows from Chadwick's palms, and when he removes them the wound is closed up. Chadwick turns to Bendron and offers the same treatment, placing his hands on Bendron's thigh in a completely nonsexual way. Once more the pale light glows dimly and when Chadwick removes his hands, Bendron's wound is nothing more than scar tissue.Bendron, fully recovered, offers his hand to Gideon. The party once again forms their train and heads into the night, away from the scene of carnage."
167,Nightwing32193,"As Gideon follows the dwarf he looks to the horizon to see when dawn would break, ""Trophies Of battle, brother. These that we slew were little better then animals anyway."""
168,RealZachKraus,"""besides, it's no way for the future chief to behave!"""
169,Nightwing32193,"""Future chief of what?"" Gideon spat back, clearly his comrade had struck a nerve."
170,Graehamkracker,"""How did you two come to be such the merry pair anyhow?"""
171,RealZachKraus,"Chadwick, taken aback by the question, paused awkwardly. Then a look of horror spread across his face. ""What are you doing so far North anyway? I was on my way to see you and didn't expect to run into you so soon."""
172,Nightwing32193,"""Everyone shut your focking gobs til we can find a place to camp. And stop holding my focking hand."" growls Gideon, ripping his hand away from the dwarf and pushing past him into the night."
173,Dragodar,"Gideon, walking in the dark and unable to see, almost immediately trips over a tree root and faceplants. The group pauses, uncertain how to proceed for the time being."
174,Graehamkracker,Bendron does not pause. But he does slow down a little so the brute has a chance to catch up.
175,Dragodar,"Bendron continues moving forward, but the group is now in disarray. Everyone behind Gideon is blind and feeling their way about in the dark, Gideon having broken the chain."
176,Nightwing32193,Gideon sits with his back against the tree that tripped him and curses in Ul Vadr.
177,BeefyChickens,"Demryon lets out a chuckle at the sound of Gideon's not so graceful fall, then remains still until the group can reform."

For what seems like an eternity, Bendron leads the party on a safe path, weaving through the camps and avoiding the Niorû. =============After nearly two hours, the sounds of the ritual fade behind them, just as the sky begins to lighten. Bendron keeps moving, getting the party safely away from the savage ceremony until it is light enough for them to walk on their own.  linkSpotify linkAs the sun begins to rise behind a thick blanket of clouds, a slight drizzle begins, dampening the already tired spirits of the group. They are exhausted, sleep-deprived, and covered in blood, but the sounds of the Niorû have faded to complete silence behind them.

Even in this temperate climate, the winter saps them of heat and drains their energy.It is early in the morning of Iru 6th, around 6 AM."

They are thoroughly exhausted, and fall asleep without issue. The rain picks up to slightly more than a drizzle but hardly bothers the enervated sleepers.Does anybody keep watch or does everybody sleep?"
184,Nightwing32193,Gideon sits with his back to a tree with his great sword against his shoulder. He stares intently at the dirt as the rain drizzles down against his body from the trees above him.
185,Graehamkracker,"Bendron volunteers to take first watch. Things are still very new to him, and he's still running on enough excitement to hold off the weariness. He finds a suitable pedestal and sets to cleaning his equipment, hands running along the halberd as he removes the grime and hones the edges - inspects it thoroughly, then sets the head back into a covering to keep it well oiled. Finished, he takes in the trees and grass and rain, uncaring of Gideon's brooding."

190,Graehamkracker,"""There's nothing you have that I would need."" Bendron replies. As his watch passes, Bendron compares the stories he was told and the truths he was taught to the things he sees in the woods. Wood seems a bit softer than he'd imagined, and grass almost tickles as he runs his hand over it. The noises of a forest are all foreign, but most mapped to various animal calls he had been told of. He was not prepared for weather. The wind's movements were expected, but the noises were not. Creaking, whistling, and rushing were one thing to hear about, but another to actually hear. And the rain. What magics must carry the water into the sky only to release it back to the ground? The world he's seen so far has been a bit less ordered than expected. Assuming an uneventful watch, of course.""Do you really see that hope in him?"""

I don't know how long you were conked out in those caverns but I can guess it's been long enough that you might not be aware of this threat. Many of the northern kingdoms banded together in this crusade of ours. His tribe happened to be in the warpath of the enemy, and on a recon mission my troops discovered them under siege. Together our people managed to push the army back and for the rest of the campaign we had that tenuous alliance. It was in my negotiations with the chief that I met Gideon. We ended up going countless missions together and, while I'm ashamed to admit it, I oftentimes used him and others as a way to get things done outside of the 'rules of war,' if you get me. All for the cause, of course. A brotherhood forged in blood is not easily broken. Eventually we pushed the enemy back, and as far as I know, routed them. But seeing him so far North worries me.

200,RealZachKraus,"Chadwick finishes out shift uneasily, rattled by his talk with the boy. Not being one to have such vivid dreams, he wished he had been able to give some better advice. Eventually he gauged his time was up and shook his barbarian friend. ""Hey, hey you. RISE my son. You're up."""
201,Nightwing32193,"Gideon wakes with a start,""UNUN!"" his eyes dart around wildly until they finally rest upon Chadwick. He shakes his head and looks at the ground and shakes his head. Taking a deep breath he rises and rubs the sleep from his eyes. Without saying a word he walks to the edge of their makeshift camp and sits down with his legs crossed, leaning his sword on his shoulder."
202,Dragodar,"Chadwick and Gideon begin to speak in low murmurs as the rest of the party sleeps.Private Conversations Thread.=============The party starts awake at the sound of Gideon's shouting. Weary eyed and sluggish of mind, they struggle to take in their situation. Awakening, they realize that there seems to be no immediate danger. But Gideon is shouting something about fire and murder, slipping between the common tongue and an unfamiliar language.By the time the party is awake enough to realize what's going on, Gideon and Chad are silently wrapped in a powerful hug, neither saying a word. Chadwick steps back and murmurs something to Gideon in a low voice, then they turn and stand shoulder to shoulder, gazing out across the hills where the sun has just recently risen. They whisper a few words to one another, then stand in silence.Listen check: (1d20-1)8Listen check: (1d20+9)13Listen check: (1d20+10)16"
203,Graehamkracker,"""Its a <i>watch, not a sodding shouting match"" Bendron calls out over the yelling as he rolls over"
204,Nightwing32193,Gideon doesn't notice. Or care. He said his piece and is now continuing his watch.
205,Dragodar,"""Lord'll sort 'em..."" and then the two stand in silence."
206,Nightwing32193,"After an hour of scouting around the campsite  survival/spot check for wilderness activity Gideon makes his way back to his sleeping companions and gently shakes Seamus, ""Hey kid, you're on watch now but if you're not feeling up to it I can take yours as well."""
207,ButcherDawg,"""No, I can do this. If you guys can do it, then I can too,"" he whispers."
208,Nightwing32193,Gideon smiled at the young boy and ruffles his hair. With that he jogs back to camp and lays down cradling his great sword.
209,Dragodar,"You are in hill country. The forest around you seems fairly normal for a wintertime forest. Not much wildlife can be seen but you are able to hear birds and see the occasional squirrel. It is a fairly mundane area. The trees extend in every direction as far as you can see, but since they lack their leaves you can see relatively far.Knowledge (History) check: (1d20+7)16If your estimation of your current location is correct and you are in fact ten miles east of the cave you woke up in, you are aware that the city of Korduur once stood near here. You are not sure of your exact location, and it has been a very long time since you've seen Korduur, but you would guess that it would be within a few miles of your current location if it still exists.The next few hours pass uneventfully, and around 3 in the afternoon, Demryon wakes the party.With the cloud cover, the risen sun is not bright enough to wake the party from their deep slumber, so everyone in the group wakes well rested, if not a bit chilly. The temperature did not rise with the sun this morning, and under the cold gray Iru sky, our band of misfit adventurers is able to see their breath coalescing in the air before them. It is about 3:00 PM on Iru 6th. The weather is foggy and overcast but thankfully not rainy... yet."
210,Nightwing32193,"""I scouted around, there's not much to speak of in this area."""
211,Graehamkracker,"""What cities or folk are in these parts now? Might they be a good place for shelter?"""
212,Nightwing32193,"Gideon packs up his gear and from one knee looks up at the dwarf, ""Folk in these lands cannot be trusted. Believe me. You're just as likely to get fire worshippers or bloodthirsty savages as you are to come across decent people."""
213,Graehamkracker,"""Used to be this place was dominated by the great trading city of Korduur - it stands some 5 or 10 miles east from here. Well rather, it's ruins likely lie there. It may be worth investigating, if we head that way and anything of worth remains"""
214,Nightwing32193,"Gideon scoffs and stands up. ""Well as interesting as that sounds, Ben, I'll be fine heading back south. Away from these storms."""
215,ButcherDawg,"""There is nothing south but rain and damp."""
216,Nightwing32193,"""If we follow this river east well reach the city of Oldevale, from there we can do time east, away from the coast and the storms. Unless one of you has a better plan."""
217,ButcherDawg,"""Lou could lead us. That is, if you could bear to trust a wolf to that extent."""
218,Graehamkracker,"""Sounds like this Oldvale may be the descendant of Korduur. I have no qualms investigating that"""
219,Nightwing32193,"""Your beast has proved competent in battle, and it's clearly linked to you in some way. Can't believe I'm about to say this. But I'd follow the wolf."""
220,ButcherDawg,"Seamus shifts his gaze to the other three, awaiting their input."
221,Graehamkracker,"Bendron nods. ""But if we pass Korduur or it's ruin, I'm stopping to look around."""
222,Nightwing32193,"""If the dwarf stops, I'll stop. All that time froze. He'll need someone to watch his ancient backside."" he says, smiling disarmingly at Bendron."
223,Graehamkracker,Bendron ignores the verbal jab. If it was a jab. He really can't tell.
224,Dragodar,"The group packs up their things, stretches their limbs, and heads east. The sky continues to drizzle lazily as the party trudges east, well rested and finally on the move. For hours, they continue their trek, using Demryon's compass to stay on course. Afternoon gives way to evening, and as the sky begins to darken, the party exits the tree line and sees the lights of a city in the distance. A little over five miles in front of them and a few degrees to their left, the tiny twinkling lights of city life sparkle in the night like the cold winter stars.It is about 8:00 PM on Iru 6th."
225,Nightwing32193,"""You lot feel like finding a place to stay?"""
226,Graehamkracker,"""Beats waking up to yelling again"""
227,Nightwing32193,"Gideon shakes his head and chuckles,""Seems as though height isn't the only thing you're lacking Bendron. But jokes as well. But in any event I think we should head to that town, maybe send Seamus and Chad in to get a feel for the townsfolk. I may frighten them, and there's always a chance that they will be unwelcome to non humans."""
228,RealZachKraus,"Chadwick straps his greataxe onto his back and rolls his neck a few times, ""yeah that seems like the way to go. I don't recognize this town but it has been awhile since I've been through this area, and the last time was at war. I could use some supplies... we can scope it out. If it seems hostile we can move along."""
229,Nightwing32193,"Gideon nods and claps his friend on the back, ""I'm sure you could handle a couple villagers with pitch forks, Chad. You dont need me to watch your back do you?"""
230,RealZachKraus,"Chadwick laughed, ""Either way, I'm itchin to go."""
231,Nightwing32193,"Gideon threw his head back and laughed aloud, ""Aye, that'd certainly be a sight. Fock it, let's all of us head down there. Seems we'd be a match for anyone in these parts anyway. Besides, Seamus will look after us."" he says with a heterosexual wink at the boy."
232,Graehamkracker,"""The history of the Yundri runs deep in this place - we transformed this wild land into a prosperous region welcome to all well-meaning folk. I'm sure there will be nothing but awe and respect."""
233,Nightwing32193,"""Well I suppose that settles it then yeah?""  "
234,RealZachKraus,"""Let's paint the town, boys! Also my wink was also heterosexual."""
235,BeefyChickens,"Demryon looking down at his shoes, ""Well, I was thinking we might head south... to Farindahl. It's much warmer and arid there; beats wet boots any day. Plus, it's home for me.""Demryon looks up at the party. ""Not to mention it's less than a hundred miles south, whereas Oldevale has gotta be at least three hundred miles east."""
236,RealZachKraus,"""Well it appears you're outnumbered dere bud. Not that this is a democracy, kuz guess who has two thumbs and needs a drink."" Chadwick points his thumbs towards himself, then raises his unarmored hand in a rude gesture towards the elf."
237,Nightwing32193,"Again Gideon chuckles at the antics of his companion,""I'm in agreement with Chad, I could use a pint or two. Mayhap alcohol will make you and Bendron a bit more bearable company.""  he says to the elf."
238,BeefyChickens,"With a bit of a furrowed brow, but paying no mind to Chads gesture, Demryon responds ""Do we know what we'll find in the direction you have chosen? I know the land I've suggested like the back of my hand. Wouldn't that be more beneficial to the party?"""
239,RealZachKraus,"""No use talking about it out here. Pick up your feet boys."""
240,Nightwing32193,"Gideon heads toward the town, not incredibly worried about whether or not the party follows, his mind, thanks to Chadwick, is on the pints."
241,Graehamkracker,"""Aye, no use arguing out in the open when there's shelter within reach. We seem to have been cast together, and may as well take a pause to settle in and decide our moves."""
242,Nightwing32193,"Hearing the dwarf, Gideon turns around and points and Bendron, ""Well said, sir. I agree."""
243,BeefyChickens,"""I suppose I could use a pint myself."""
244,RealZachKraus,"""There may be hope for you yet, friend."" Chadwick starts off towards the town."
245,ButcherDawg,"""Are you talking about alcohol?"
246,Nightwing32193,"""Aye, lad!"
247,Dragodar,"The party heads toward the town, agreeing to decide on a better plan once they've had some alcohol. It takes them about an hour to reach the gates, by which time the sky is completely dark.You recognize this town as the small city of Aldus. It's main function is as a logging hub for dwarves from Urdale. It is a somewhat sleepy town, though not completely unexposed to the outside world. Knowing where you are, you can be sure that Farindahl is about 90 miles south, and Oldevale is about 280 miles east.Upon entering the large town, or small city, our company of beatniks is quick to ask around for the nearest pub. Next to the main gate, a sleepy looking guard sits on a wooden stool, reading a newsletter. He is happy to point the group to a nearby pub called <i>The Spitting Wench. The group walks down the street and after a few turns, sees a crudely painted sign of a buxom barmaid with her cheeks puffed out and a surprised look in her eyes.In keeping with it's name, the bar is a very classy place. Inside, our party finds four wooden tables surrounded by wooden chairs, and a bar at the back. The tables have crumbs of food and puddles of liquid on them, and the bar itself is no different. As they watch, the fat barmaid picks her nose and then goes back to wiping a wooden mug with a dirty looking rag. As if to advertise the popularity of the place, a single patron sits at the end of the bar. A dirty looking logger, the chubby man slurps ale loudly from a mug similar to the one in the barmaid's hands.It is about 9:00 PM on Saturday, Iru 6th."
248,RealZachKraus,"""This would be the best we get, eh. The day I've been having.. This is no place for a child."" But his eyes said he wasn't too commited to that sentiment."
249,Nightwing32193,"""He'll be fine, brother, he's no older then I was when I started drinking. Sure it's a bit rough and honestly, pretty shetty, but fock it. I got the first round."" he walks up to the bar and orders five mugs of ale."
250,Dragodar,The barmaid hardly acknowledges Gideon but quickly serves up five mugs of frothy ale. She slams them down on the bar without a word and then goes back to wiping the mug.
251,BeefyChickens,"""If you could bring five more when we finish these!"""
252,Dragodar,"The barmaid gives a single nod and a half eye roll as if to say, <i>""Yeah, whateva"" and wordlessly keeps wiping."
253,Nightwing32193,"Gideon shrugs and takes the mugs off the bar and brings them to a table where his party is gotten themselves situated. '""Drink up ladies"""
254,RealZachKraus,"Chadwick shruggs, bellying up. He takes a huge quaff off his mug and immediately feels better. It's watery rat piss. ""You know what we need, some hardy northern whiskey. That'll put a tingler in the tummy, for sure."""
255,Graehamkracker,"Bendron takes a sip, and recoils in disgust. ""This is what passes for alcohol these days? This is a watery soup. Alcohol used to make your tongue burn and bubble down the throat."""
256,ButcherDawg,"Seamus pulls the mug close and looks down into it. He then turns to Lou sitting on the floor beside him who returns a head-tilted look of concern. Looking back into his beer, he tries to drink it without lifting the heavy glass, immediately gagging and coughing up froth."
257,Dragodar,"Hearing Chadwick's words, the man at the end of the bar speaks up. ""They got Timbergrove Single Malt at the Squeaky Sparrow on the other side of town.""At his words, the barmaid pipes up for the first time. ""Oi! Tryin ta lose me business, focka?"" She shouts angrily. She hurls the mug she's been wiping at the man, who curses and stands up. He drops a few coins on the bar, gives the barmaid the finger, and storms out of the bar, leaving an awkward silence in his wake. Only the party and the barmaid remain.The barmaid produces another mug from out of nowhere and begins wiping it as though nothing has happened."
258,RealZachKraus,"Chadwick reaches over and pats him on the back. ""That's alright kid. Lemme finish that for you, looks like we're outta here."" He downs his mug and stands up."
259,Graehamkracker,"Bendron also offers his mug, proffered between the two men."
260,Dragodar,"""Aw come on, love,"" the barmaid whines. ""What about you's next round?"""
261,Nightwing32193,"Gideon produces a flask from his belt and hands it to Chad. Then he turns to his mug, lifts it to his lips and starts drinking. He finishes the entire brew and slams the mug down on the bar table."
262,ButcherDawg,"Seamus uses both hands to lift the beer mug, about the  size of his head, up to his lips. Doing so, he takes three large gulps and sets the mug loudly back on the bar."
263,RealZachKraus,"Chadwick laughs a long laugh that turns into a belch.""That'll play,"" he coughs."
264,Nightwing32193,"Gideon throws his head back in sheer merriment and lets out a loud, hearty laugh,I'm kidding, this is absolute swill."""
265,Dragodar,"Seeing her only customers preparing to leave, the barmaid arrives at the table with five more mugs before Demryon can cancel his second order. ""That'll be foive silva all togevva, loves."""
266,ButcherDawg,"Seamus lets out a deep belch that completely takes him by surprise. Smiling, "" 'Scuse me."""
267,Nightwing32193,"""I mean at least be honest about what you're selling. Nice one, Seamus."""
268,Graehamkracker,"Bendron again passes on the 'alcohol', but settles into the seat and considers his companions. ""Now that we have a moment's respite, where do we go from here? It seems that we've been cast together for one reason or another, but I'm not sure if any know what that may be. For myself, my first aim is to see if I can't find any remnants of my clan, and the only way to do that is to travel. All directions seem equally promising there."""
269,Nightwing32193,"Gideon' s face grows solemn as he stares down his third mug of ale. He looks around at the party, staring each one individually in the eyes, ""Aye, you aim to find your clan, I aim to fight to take mine back. To the south and east of here lies a kingdom ruled by a warlord known as Genji. Fancies himself some sort of King. That lordship Is mine by birth right. I can offer all of you substantial payment as well as positions of power within the kingdom if you were to help me reclaim it. This is something I will do alone but it never hurts to bring a up a band of capable fighters along."" "
270,Dragodar,"The barmaid's supplicating tone disappears as everyone ignores her. ""Who's paying?"" she asks loudly in a flat tone."
271,ButcherDawg,A wooden thud sounds as Seamus sets down the suddenly empty mug onto the bar. His chin and neck glisten as the front of his shirt looks soaked in beer. His eyes bug out briefly in astonishment before he trains his ears back to the conversation.
272,RealZachKraus,"""Who's got this round, my wallet's in my other greaves."""
273,RealZachKraus,"Chadwick looks around expectantly. ""Anyone? Anyone? Damn, tough pub."" He reaches into his pack, pulls out a few coins and sets them on the bar, taking another swig from the flask Gideon hadn't asked to be returned."
274,ButcherDawg,"""Have you any mutton? I am peckish at least."""
275,Graehamkracker,"""Demryon, what brought you out here by yourself?"""
276,Nightwing32193,Gideon nods his thanks to Chad for buying the round. Then procedes to continue drinking from the unattended mugs of ale on the table in front of him.
277,Dragodar,"""Oh, so... You're staying then?"" says the barmaid, with an ostenible look of pleasant surprise. ""Oh. Right then.""She returns to bar and continues to wipe the same mug, though with the rag she's using, it might very well be making the mug dirtier. She doesn't seem to hear Seamus' request."
278,BeefyChickens,"""Well Bendron, home brings me here, duty bring me here. I look around at my current company and see just what I've been searching for. There's a reason I am wanting to head south to Farindahl, so I suppose I'll get straight to the point. I need your help..."" he looks all of them in the eyes solemnly. ""The survivors and I attacked several of their encampments for weeks, slowly weakening his force in hopes of taking back our beloved home, but just a short while ago we were found, some were slain while they slept, others captured. I alone was able to evade those foul orcs. I would kill them all myself but I'm just one man... I can't abandon my men.""""I will have no choice but to move on if you cannot help me, but I offer a handsome reward to those who will help me take back Farindahl... I realize this is a lot to put onto yuh... but at least give it some thought gentlemen."""
279,Nightwing32193,"Gideon finishes his fourth pint in almost as many minutes. He wipes his mouth and leans haphazardly back in his seat, looking at Demryon, ""In my humble opinion."" Then, after downing his drink, in a slightly louder voice, with his attention turned seemingly towards the barmaid, ""You are the ugliest focking woman I have ever seen, it's no wonder you have no patrons!"""
280,Dragodar,"The barmaid glances up at the sound of Gideon's call. She doesn't understand the language, but makes an assumption. ""More beer?"" she asks quizzically, pausing her perpetual wiping of the mug in her hands."
281,Nightwing32193,"""There's no amount of alcohol in this world that would ever make you attractive, wench!"" Then switching back to the common tongue, ""Sure thing, love! This one's on the house though right?""""Because we may actually be drinking literal poison right now, I can't be sure, tastes like horse piss."" he laughs then motions for his flask back from Chadwick."
282,Dragodar,"""Can't do that, mate. Not my ale to give away."" The barmaid returns to the bar and begins filling five more mugs."
283,Nightwing32193,"""So you don't brew this yourself then? Who does? And just make it two, not five. These two aren't drinkin' it seems."" he calls, motioning to Bendron and Demryon"
284,Graehamkracker,"""Seems like the two of you have pretty similar plights. But what makes you think that you're yet ready to make your claim? Or that the folk you claim would accept you if you were to win?"""
285,ButcherDawg,"Seamus, realizing the barmaid has completely ignored him, lifts an empty fist and mimes his teeth into a mouthful of imaginary mutton and smiles sarcastically as he chews air."
286,BeefyChickens,"""Whether or not I am accepted is irrelevant. However I believe I'll be accepted with much gratitude. My aim is not to stake my claim to anything but my people's freedom."""
287,ButcherDawg,"Seamus joyfully finishing the imaginary mutton and begins licking the airy taste off his fingers. Then smiles and slides his imaginary, empty mutton plate off to the side and slides another imaginary plate in front of him: the second course--soup."
288,Nightwing32193,"""For the love of Kord woman will you feed this boy!"" he calls to the barmaid."
289,Dragodar,"The barmaid starts at Gideon's shout and rushes over with a large loaf of hard bread and a bowl of salted pretzels. ""We don't serve food here, just drink snacks."" She sets the hunk of bread and the bowl on the table along with two more mugs of ale."
290,Nightwing32193,"""Fat, lazy betch."" Gideon then picks up one of the two mugs and begins sipping on it. But he can't take it anymore. He calls the barmaid, look her directly in the eyes and begins pouring the ale on the floor,""This wouldn't even pass as beer for Muors. You should be ashamed to serve this swill."" he says as he drops the mug on the floor and starts heading towards the door, taking another pull from his flask, then tossing it in Chadwick's direction."
291,Graehamkracker,"""All these new cities. Does anyone have a map and any idea of where we are? I see no reason that we may not help you both so long as your peoples do want your aid, but we cannot have two missions at once. Lad, I know you and Lou seem to have your own missive, but our meeting may have been fortuitous. She seems quite happy here."""
292,Nightwing32193,"Gideon makes a 180 and sits down to give his two cents. Pulling out a map, he takes a few seconds to study it, then let's out a great, long, borderline sarcastic sigh (as if to say ""My standing price has 5 gold per week, elf. I'm not changing it, unless you want to work something out in advance. But I sympathize with your plight, and I'm very sorry about your father. Farindahl is close. Let's go hunt some orc."""
293,BeefyChickens,"""I offer my most sincere gratitude, Gideon... I don't keep that kind of coin on my person, but I will gladly fulfill that pay rate once we've taken Farindahl."" says Demryon, offering his hand."
294,Nightwing32193,"Gideon pauses a second. He purses his lips and sighs. He looks at Demryon, then up at the ceiling ""Jacen, watch over me, forgive me for working with an elf, but I sympathize with his plight, as it is the same as mine. All I do, I do in your name father."" switching seamlessly back into common, ""Aye, my pleasure."" and shakes the elf's hand."
295,ButcherDawg,"Seamus grabs a handful of pretzels and jumps down from the bar stool. About to snarf it all down, he spots Lou in the corner of his eye, lying with her head on the floor and looking up at him pathetically. Seamus sighs and throws half of the pretzels on the floor before here snout. The rest, he shoves into his mouth and eats. With a mouthful, he replies to Bendron, ""I suppose I could stay longer on your quest."""
296,Graehamkracker,"""Sounds that we are decided then, so long as we have been played true. May be time to head to a more suitable roof for rest and merriment before we head out."""
297,Nightwing32193,"""You have a good head on your shoulders, dwarf. I couldn't agree more, fock this place. I for one don't need a roof above my head, but an actual bed would be a welcomed change."""
298,BeefyChickens,"""Sure beats a cave floor, aye, Bendron?"" Demryon says with a chuckle."
299,Nightwing32193,"Gideon laughs and nods, ""Good one"" Then in common, ""So, shall we find...an inn? Is that what you call it?"" Ul Vadr are a nomadic people, the concept of a hotel is relatively foreign."
300,Graehamkracker,"""Why would one sleep on feathers? Seems incredibly itchy and uncomfortable. The earth is welcoming enough."""
301,Dragodar,"Lou quickly scarfs up the pretzels Seamus threw her, casting a grateful look in his direction. As the party gathers their things and prepares to leave, the barmaid walks back to the table. ""A'right, gents.

306,Dragodar,"Across the street, a rowdy group of four young men go walking by, laughing and carousing. Their voices carry but quickly fade as they walk up the street and round a corner. As the party stands outside <i>The Spitting Wench planning their next course of action, a few tiny snowflakes fall from the sky. Soon, a very light flurry is drifting down silently around them."

320,RealZachKraus,"Chadwick laughs. ""The kid shows a fire beyond his years who are we to keep him from his destiny. Let's find an inn where we can stay and anyone can get to bed if they feel so inclined."""
321,ButcherDawg,"Seamus takes the flask and takes a swig, showing disgust only by the most subtle nostril flare. He hands it back to Gideon."
322,Nightwing32193,"Gideon is visibly surprised. He takes the flask back and finishes it. Still awestruck, ""You're about to have a bad time, kid.""Turning to Chad, ""Well you've certainly been quiet, did that breaches joke really get you down?"" "
323,RealZachKraus,"Chadwick looks quizzically at Gideon, ""the hell you talkin about mate, square uppp."" He jokingly assumes a sparring postion and starts moving his hands around in a mock martial arts fashion."
324,Nightwing32193,"Gideon takes his great sword off of his back and lays it on the ground next to him. "" are we actually doing this mate? Remember what happened last time we brawled."""

326,Nightwing32193,"Gideon laughs uproariously, wiping tears of merriment from his eyes he gently pats Seamus on the back, ""how you doing there lad?"""
327,ButcherDawg,"""A gud master always provives for his servantsss,"" he says, looking down to see Lou lapping up the vomit."
328,Nightwing32193,"Slightly disgusted but still very amused Gideon leans up against the wall of the bar,  ""Indeed. Now somebody get this boy to bed?"""
329,BeefyChickens,"With a look of disgust, Demryon comments, ""Oh, that is vile."""
330,Dragodar,"Across the street, another group of young adults walk merrily, laughing and joking as they make their way up the street. From where our party stands in front of the <i>The Spitting Wench, they are walking from right to left; the same direction as the last group who passed. There are about six to eight of them, approximately equal number men and women; all look to be in their twenties and are having an obviously good time tonight. Within a few seconds, they turn left and disappear around the corner as their laughs fade with them."
331,ButcherDawg,"""Thanks. I'm goin to goin with thems,"" Seamus points after the group of strangers and turns to follow them around the corner."
332,Graehamkracker,"""Follow the fool it is then."" Bendron scowls and sets off in lackadaisical pursuit of Seamus."
333,Nightwing32193,"Gideon chuckles to himself, "" this is not going to end well but I'm all for it.""""Hey, wait up!"" picks up his sword and follows them."
334,RealZachKraus,"""Ahh sh!t, shoulda seen this one coming. Don't let him catch up to them."""
335,Nightwing32193,""" or, let him? where's your sense of adventure Chad?' Gideon calls back over shoulder."
336,Dragodar,"The party follows the loud group around the bend. After several twists and turns through the narrow streets, the party sees the group enter through a large double door into a crowded building. The occupants of the building spill out into the street, a wide variety of people, some holding flagons of ale, some smoking pipes, all laughing and speaking merrily. The sound of loud conversation and laughter echoes from inside. Above the double door is a brightly painted sign of a small songbird whistling a merry tune. One of the men standing in the street calls out to the group. ""Oi! What the fock are yous doing without drinks in you's hands? It's Saturdaaaay, lads!"" The man shambles up to the party. He sports a thick gray mustache and wears a prospector's hat. His dirty overalls give away his lowly occupation, but he greets the party happily and throws his arm around Chadwick's shoulder. ""Drink up me hearty!"" the man shouts as he pushes his flagon into Chad's hands. He then proceeds to burst into hysterical laughter, leaning on Chadwick to avoid falling over."
337,Graehamkracker,"""Is it some sort of local feast day?"" Bendron asks the man, confused at the size and roudiness of the crowd"
338,Dragodar,"The man chuckles and hiccups. ""Why yesh it is."" He pauses, opening and closing his mouth several times to wet his whistle while opening his yes very wide to test his vision. ""Very shpecial holiday indeed lad... We call it Shaturday."" The man looks at the flagon in Chad's hands. ""Is that mine?"""
339,ButcherDawg,"Seamus stumbles up to the man. ""Might I use yer sh-shart to wipe my face?"""
340,Nightwing32193,"""Where can i find a flagon such as that old man?""  DEX check to catch Seamus before he knocks over the dude"
341,Dragodar,"(1d20+1)9""In there!"" the man roars in response to Gideon. Looking down at Seamus with surprise, he says ""Oh hell, laddie. Uh yeah go for it."" Gideon reaches out to grab Seamus, but the boy is already wiping his face on the man's overalls.The man politely waits for Seamus to finish, then grabs his mug from Chad's hands and sloppily finishes the drink, releasing a loud belch.""Shcuse me..."" he says. He takes his arm from around Chad's shoulder and walks over to the wall of the building, where he sits down on the ground and leans against the wall, his chin resting on his chest. Within seconds, the party can hear his snores."
342,ButcherDawg,"Seamus points back at the man's shirts and reacts in a bummed-out surprise, ""Oh no! Oh, man. I'm so sorry I got I got, like, some vomit on your shirt. B-But no worries though. It's cool. It's fine."""
343,Dragodar,The man is already blissfully snoring and does not hear Seamus' words. A rowdy burst of shouts and laughter erupts from inside the pub.
344,Nightwing32193,"Gideon shrugs and walks towards the entrance to the building in search of more drink. As he nears the door he remembers that he's still wearing all his weapons and does as good of a 180 as he can manage back to the group,""Uh, yeah, i'm have all my weapons on still. Lets find a camp first yeah?"""
345,Graehamkracker,"""A roof may do us better, and they may have it"""
346,Nightwing32193,"Gideon snaps his fingers and points at the dwarf,""Yes! A roof, thats it. An inn even? Im sure we can find one in this place."""
347,Dragodar,It doesn't take much searching at all to find an inn. Directly across the street from <i>The Squeaky Sparrow stands a comfortable looking inn with a large sign that reads <i>The Down Pillow Inn in fancy embellished writing.
348,ButcherDawg,"""If we go in there... then we will be IN the INN..."" Seamus mouths ""whoah."""
349,Nightwing32193,"Gideon enters the Inn and walks up to the counter, ringing the bell for service."
350,Graehamkracker,"Bendron stays outside, trying to gather Seamus and hands him a waterskin. ""Here you are lad, best if we let them sort out the rooms and we keep our mess out here."""
351,Nightwing32193,"""Service! Service!"""
352,Dragodar,"Inside <i>The Down Pillow Inn, you find yourselves in a dimly lit foyer. In the middle is a small counter with a doorway behind it, and on either side of the counter are two hallways that run toward the back of the building. From the darkened doorway behind the counter, a short, rotund man wearing spectacles comes scurrying out.""Yes, yes! Welcome! My name is Matthias. I assume you seek lodging for the night?"" he says is a friendly high pitched voice."
353,BeefyChickens,Demryon follows enters the inn.
354,Nightwing32193,"""Aye, what are your rates?"" "
355,Dragodar,"""If you would like to sleep in the common area in the back, you are welcome to find a spot on the floor. There is a hearth that is kept burning throughout the night, so please avoid sleeping on the marked path that the help uses to keep logs on the fire. The common area is two silver per person per night."" The bespectacled innkeeper smiles and clears his throat.""If, on the other hand, you would like private rooms, the cost will be higher. The rooms are kept warm by individual chimneys that come from the furnace in our cellar. Each room has a bed, a bedside table, a desk, and a chair. The rooms are two gold per night, and we ask that you do not have more than three people per room.""The man pulls out a quill and ink jar from under the counter, and then produces a large logbook. ""What will it be tonight, gentlemen?"""
356,Nightwing32193,"""Private room sounds good to me. What about the rest of you?"""
357,Dragodar,"Between the five of them, the party pays for two separate rooms. The total cost comes to four gold, and they head upstairs to unpack their things and turn in for the first good night's sleep they've had in a long while."
358,Graehamkracker,"Bendron has had a lot of sleep recently. 8 hours after laying down on a piece of the floor, he's up and seeing if any of the others were awake and willing to have a quick walk around the town, to explore and see if there was anything worth doing in town before heading south."
359,Dragodar,"After a relatively relaxing night of drinking, the party rents a pair of rooms at <i>The Down Pillow Inn and gladly fall asleep straightaway.=============The sun rises bright and early the next day, around 6 AM. Bendron is awake and ready to go while the others rise groggily. Well rested and reinvigorated, the party is ready to get an early start on the day."
360,Nightwing32193,"Gideon yawns and rubs the sleep from his eyes. Then almost immediately clutches his head,""Oh, gods, this is always the worst part.""""Is Seamus still alive? Didn't take him for a drinker."""
361,Dragodar,
362,Graehamkracker,"Tired of waiting for the rest, Bendron tries to poke Seamus awake."
363,Nightwing32193,"""Time to pay for your sins boy. Wake up!"" calls Gideon from across the room."
364,Graehamkracker,"Seeing the boy is suffering from a particularly nasty hangover, Bendron moves picks the lad up and carry him along until he is fit to walk.(1d20+8)26"
365,Nightwing32193,"Gideon lets out a chuckle then immediately starts rubbing his temples, ""Gods, fock me."""
366,Graehamkracker,"Lifting the suffering boy onto his shoulders, Bendron heads towards the door. ""Come, let's find the rest and head south. We've a long way to go and much to see along the way."""
367,Dragodar,"Bendron gently slings Seamus over his shoulder and heads out the door. Collecting their things, the party follows Bendron. After returning their keys at the front desk, the party makes their way outside, blinking in the bright sunlight. The street bustles with daytime activity; shopkeepers calling out their wares and residents rushing to and fro, running their daily errands."
368,Nightwing32193,"Gideon takes a long drink from his water skin. It takes a moment for his eyes and ears to adjust to the outside before he speaks, ""Alright, to Elf country? Or did anyone want to look around a bit?"""
369,Graehamkracker,"""Would this be the place to stock up on coin and provision? Or should we stop along the way?"""
370,Dragodar,"A guard who happens to be patrolling the street glances over at the party and then changes direction toward them. His loose black locks frame a youthful but strong face. He reaches them and takes his sword from its position resting comfortably on his shoulder, planting the tip of it in the ground and leaning on it for support.""Mornin' fellas. Mind if I ask your business in Aldus?"" The guard's tone is casual an he smiles as he speaks, but he does not takes his eyes off of Bendron as he says this. In particular, he seems interested in the semi-conscious body of Seamus hanging over the dwarf's shoulder."
371,Graehamkracker,"""I do not have a business"""
372,Nightwing32193,"""That's a cute sword ya got there, now why don't you put it away before someone gets hurt, yeah? We're just minding our own business here."""
373,Dragodar,"The guard glances at Gideon. His friendly tone hardens slightly without completely disappearing, as he responds, ""It would be better if you not tell an officer of the law what to do with his weapon. Since you folks don't seem to like cooperating, I'll just say it flat out. Who's the kid, and where are you taking him?""By this point another guard, walking a similar patrol down the street, approaches the group. ""Everything alright here, John?"" the second guard asks his companion. He sports a thick brown mustache and looks to be several years John's senior. He leaves his sword leaning on his shoulder as he pauses to ask the question.""Certainly, Ed. I've just asked these gentlemen their business in Aldus, of which they have none apparently. I've also asked them who the unconscious youth is, and they have yet to provide a satisfactory response for that as well.""Ed glances from John to the party, waiting expectantly."
374,ButcherDawg,"""Nobodys gonna carry me in... ever!"""
375,Graehamkracker,"""Again, I have no business. I am no craftman. As for they boy, he didn't sleep well, so I'm helping him along so we don't lose the day. We're heading out of town. To the South, i believe."""
376,Dragodar,"The guards look at each other, confused as to whether they should be amused or concerned. Ed speaks up. ""Do you know these fellows, lad? Are you alright?""John looks at Bendron. ""I'm sorry, I should have been more clear. I meant, what is it you're doing in Aldus? I only ask because I haven't seen you fellows around, and I'm rather good with faces."""
377,Nightwing32193,"""Ha, I see what you did there Ben, nice one. But the lad'sawake, so we must be on our way. Goodbye"" "
378,Dragodar,"Ed looks at Gideon. ""Come on now, don't make this difficult for everyone. We're only trying to do our job. Four big fellas walking down the street with a limp kid in tow looks like funny business, you have to admit that.""John smiles apologetically at Bendron. ""We can't let you go until we've had a talk with the kid."""
379,RealZachKraus,"Chadwick waves the officer off. ""We've been travelling, only stopped through for the night. Nice town you got here. Hope to visit again."" He steps back and waves the rest of the party through."
380,Dragodar,"The guards look at each other and sigh. John looks at Chadwick. ""Please don't make us call for back up. This would be much easier if we just talked."" Ed grabs a horn from his belt and places it to his lips, not blowing it yet but preparing to."
381,RealZachKraus,"Chad steps closer to the guard, ""Up until this point we've been shown very excellent hospitality. Do you question all visitors this way? I hear you though, can't be too careful. I'm from a military town, I remember when I was growing up, checkpoints this checkpoints that.. I appreciated it later though, kept us safe..""Quietly, making it sound like a curse""i distract, move out town""""Pardon my language, we had a bit of a late night last night. One very exuberant man turned us on to your glorious local tradition of ""Saturday,"" Chadwick laughs disarmingly."
382,Nightwing32193,"""Gods, your grammar is as bad as ever, Chad, just let them talk to the boy, after that if we are detained any longer we'll do that."""
383,ButcherDawg,"Seamus fails at pushing himself to his feet twice, landing face first in the mud. Finally he finds his balance and stumbles over to the guards. ""And another thing! Could you please lower your voices for just a few... forever."""
384,Dragodar,"The guards smile at Seamus' words. ""Alright, lad, glad you're okay,"" says John with a chuckle. Ed looks up at Chadwick. ""First taste of the ole sauce for this one, last night?"" He jerks his thumb in Seamus' direction while laughing good naturedly.John address Bendron. ""Can't be too careful. Kidnapping isn't a huge problem in Aldus, but it happens. Wouldn't want some mother coming to us tomorrow wailing about her boy gone missing.""Ed turns to Gideon. ""Sorry to keep you boys, go ahead and be on your way."""
385,Nightwing32193,"Gideon casually salutes the two gaurds,""No trouble at all lads, just be careful of who you draw your sword on, just friendly advice is all."""
386,RealZachKraus,"""It's mornings like these where boys become men."""
387,ButcherDawg,"Seamus looks back to the guards as they pass, ""Listen if you hear me scream in the distance. That means I've changed my mind!"""
388,Dragodar,"The guards chuckle at Seamus' words and carry on down the road. The sun shines merrily, low in the eastern sky, its feeble warmth doing little against the cold winter air.It is about 7 AM on Sunday, Iru 7th."
389,Graehamkracker,"""So southwest through the mountains? If things haven't changed too much, I think I may know a few routes through.(1d20+7)13"
390,RealZachKraus,"Chadwick frowns, ""For real, I'm loath to go near those mountains again. In fact, I'm not sure I wanna see another mountain the rest of my life."""
391,Nightwing32193,"""Fock right off, Chadwick.""""And I'm loath, whatever the fock that means, to leave land. With the dwarf leading us, I'm sure we will be fine."" he says, eyeing Bendron."
392,Nightwing32193, look around for a suitable horse i can steal. 
393,RealZachKraus,"""take sh!t, ya fvckin..""""...duster. If you think I'm always gonna be there to save your ass from..""""some black magic bullsh!t...""""I wouldn't be so sure."""
394,Nightwing32193,"""You know i love you, brother."""
395,Dragodar,"About fifty feet down the road, on the other side of the street, two horses are harnessed to a lightweight cart full of vegetables.(1d20+0)15The horse on the left is a brown mare, and the one on the right is a white gelding. They are both about 13 hands tall."
396,Nightwing32193,"""Chad, horses.""he says and motions down the street."
397,RealZachKraus,"""No. Fvckin. Way."""
398,Nightwing32193,"Gideon sighs and nods. Gideon is going to make an attempt to get lost in the crowd, gauge the situation, and if possible attempt to steal the faster/stronger looking of the two. I'd like yo use my survival skill, i'm assuming i cant though so whatever. I'd also like a layout of the situation before i attempt yhe theft."
399,RealZachKraus,"""a deal? make trade?"""
400,Dragodar,"After making their way around town and restocking on supplies, the party continues making their way south to the edge of town. Lou pads cheerily behind them, wagging her tail. As the sun rises ever higher in the sky, our motley crew of adventurers leave the town of Aldus, finally heading south to Farindahl. Fully stocked on supplies, they are ready to face the long, three day walk ahead of them.=============The road south is a fairly smooth one, and for the first several hours, the party enjoys an easy going stroll through the countryside. Several times, they pass a cart or a group of merchants, but these occurrences grow more and more infrequent as the hours pass.=============By the time noon rolls around, the party is ready to stop for lunch. After nearly five hours of walking, they are ready for a rest, too. The party breaks formation and moves off the road to some nearby rocks which make for relatively comfortable seats. They munch happily on their rations as they enjoy the soft warmth of the winter sun.It is about 12 PM on Sunday, Iru 7th."
401,Nightwing32193,"Gideon lays down, placing his greatsword next to him and looks at Chadwick, ""Feel like sparring?"""

405,Graehamkracker,"Bendron sees what promises to be a great lot of fun to watch. He takes a few minutes to stretch out and refocus, then finds a comfortable perch to watch the show."
406,Dragodar,"Chadwick and Gideon engage in a friendly spar, getting their blood flowing but being careful not to tire themselves out. Knowing that they have five more hours of marching ahead of them today, they take it easy. Soon, everyone has eaten and rested their weary limbs. After about an hour of rest, the party once again hits the road. The trees around them begin to cast long purple shadows as the sun dips lower and lower in the sky. The small amount of warmth the sun had afforded them fades along with its light; the night creeps in along with the cold. The party decides to stop and make camp.Soon after, the sun finally sinks completely below the horizon. They reckon they've traveled about fifteen miles since they started early this morning. There is plenty of tree cover surrounding them, on either side of the road. Making their way well off the road, the party settles in.It is about 7 PM on Sunday, Iru 7th."
407,Nightwing32193,Make a spot check to see if I can see the mountains over the tree line. 
408,Nightwing32193,"""Can't see the mountains yet, probably another days march til we reach them."""
409,Dragodar,"Another day's march proved Gideon's words accurate. As the sun began to reach its zenith on the party's second day of travel, the mountains came in to view on the southern horizon. And by the time the sun was setting, the party was almost upon them. Within the first couple of hours of their third day, they would reach the base of the mountains.As the party settles down for their second night on the road, the sun dips below the horizon and once again the cool winter nighttime takes over. The party beds down for the night to get some rest.=============The night passes without event as you get your sleep, but soon Gideon wakes you up for your share of the watch. For a couple hours, the night remains quiet and nothing happens. But after about two hours, you hear a slight noise in the trees. Whatever it is is outside the light of the campfire so you see nothing. But there was definitely movement of some kind.It is very early in the wee hours of the morning on Tuesday, Iru 9th."
410,BeefyChickens,"Demryon nudges Bendron, to wake him, and says quietly ""Wake up man, I think I heard something...do you see anything?"""
411,Graehamkracker,"Bendron stirs, and looks out the way Demryon points. ""Any idea how big it may be?"" He asks as he scans the woods, grabbing his Halberd and heading towards where the other three are sleeping."
412,Dragodar,"(1d20-1)9You see a slight movement and a vague shape, but it slips behind the trees before you can get a good look. It seems large though, and moves with a strange scuffle. It certainly wasn't bipedal, but you really couldn't get a good enough look to make out any details."
413,Graehamkracker,"""You're right, definitely something there. Moves kinda weirdly - and almost seems to be trying to hide. Probably best to wake the others a bit early.""  Bendron wakes the others gently, quietly explaining what was going on and telling them to be ready."
414,Dragodar,"As Bendron wakes the others, Lou is already up, barring her teeth and staring in the direction of the movement, but making no noise.Soon, the party is awake and alert. A slight rasping sound can be heard, like the sound of a rake or hoe tilling the earth and scratching across dirt and rocks. It begins loud but very quickly grows steadily quieter, as though becoming further away.Lou does not move a muscle. Her hair seems to stand on end as her hackles are raised. The angry snarl on her face does not waver but she makes no sound. Her eyes dart back and forth in the direction the scratching noise had come from."
415,BeefyChickens,"Demryon raises his trusty bow, drawing an arrow from its quiver."
416,Graehamkracker,"""Lou still seems rattled though - think it may be a trick?"""
417,BeefyChickens,"""Whatever it was, it was smart enough to move on, at least for now. It may just be going to get some friends. It may be wise for us to move camp..."""
418,Dragodar,"Without warning, Lou begins to bark frantically, clawing at the ground below her as though trying to dig. Her eyes are focused intently on the ground directly in front of her snout as she barks and growls at it aggressively. Her hackles stand tall as her tail extends out directly behind her; all her fur seems to puff out, making her appear larger as she angrily snarls at the ground.She backs away from the campfire, toward the edge of the clearing, her eyes still on the ground in front of her. Her eyes dart back and forth across the clearing, as though searching the ground. Her barks are interrupted with intermittent whines of apprehension as she continues to claw at the dirt."
419,Graehamkracker,"Bendron moves to flank Lou, back a few feet from the ground she is upset about. He braces the butt of his halberd into the ground and calls the others' attention. ""Boy, either your friend has gone mad, or we've got a burrower. Grab your stuff and get ready."""
420,ButcherDawg,"Seamus kneels beside Lou. ""What is it, girl? What are you on about?""Can i interpret Lou's behavior?"
421,Dragodar,"Seamus appraoches Lou, trying to determine what's wrong, but she does not change her behavior when he speaks to her. He is unable to determine the cause of her distress.Suddenly, Lou's barking turns to whining and she backs away further toward the edge of the campsite. A moment of silence hangs in the air, and then is shattered as the campfire explodes, sending fiery shards of kindling spraying in every direction. The party flinches, trying to avoid the shrapnel, as the ground underneath the campfire erupts. Where the fire sat crackling moments before, a massive crater caves in, revealing a clutter of long, segmented legs. The hole is about five feet across, and from it emerges a huge insect-like creature, as grotesque as it is terrifying. The giant bug squeals in a pitch almost too high to hear as its many legs scramble to find foothold on solid ground. Soon it stands before them, clicking its pincers and stabbing its forelegs in the air, its antennae gently probing the air.It's about 10 feet long, looks to be anywhere from 700 to 900 pounds. This is thing is HUGE.(1d20+1)15Demryon: (1d20+9)15Gideon: (1d20+3)12Seamus: (1d20+3)16Chadwick: (1d20+2)12Bendron: (1d20+2)16"

447,Dragodar,"Chadwick looks to the trees, unable to see the attackers and unwilling to waste his time with them. He sighs with exasperation. ""Fine. I'll go get the dwarf.""He takes a running start and leaps into the tunnel at the center of the camp.The passage is dark but fairly wide, and Chad barely has to duck to avoid hitting his head. Sprinting after the insect, he is able to hear the scratching of it's chitinous body through the hard earth, and he quickly catches up with it. Though there is no light, he is able to pull a sunrod from his pack while holding his axe with his off hand, without slowing down. Smacking it on the wall of the tunnel, he is suddenly able to see his environment.A few feet ahead of Chad, the massive bug is roughly dragging a weakly struggling Bendron through the narrow tunnel. With a cry of righteous fury, Chadwick tosses the sunrod on the ground a few feet ahead of him and grasps his axe with both hands, raising it as high as he is able in the narrow confines of the hole.Attack: (1d20+5)18Damage: (1d12+3)10Chadwick brings his axe down hard on the creature's head, severing it instantly.

449,Dragodar,"As Seamus jumps into the tunnel, prepared to cast his spell, he sees Chadwick leaning over the dwarf, a familiar glowing light emanating from his palms. Behind them, illuminated by a glowing sunrod on the floor of the tunnel, the insect lies separated from its gargantuan head, its body still twitching disgustingly."

457,ButcherDawg,"""Lou! You dirty girl!"" Seamus says with an impressive expression."
458,Nightwing32193,"Gideon picks up the dead man's bow and collects the rest of the arrows. Then kneels down, mutters something in his native tongue and brings his fist down on the corpses mouth."
459,Dragodar,"The party approaches the body of their attacker. He appears to have been a man in his late thirties or early forties. His hair is dark and mostly soaked in his own blood, and Demryon's arrow protrudes from his chest. He wears a black cloak and studded leather armor. In his hand is the bow he used to attack the group; it is carved with supreme craftsmanship and bears no flaw. On his shoulder is a cloth quiver holding a thick stack of arrows. On his back is a sturdy leather pack with shiny brass clasps that bear strange carved markings. And around his neck, he wears a silver amulet that seems to shine as though polished to perfection.Gideon kneels beside the corpse, grabbing the bow from the lifeless hand and pulling the quiver off the shoulder, before punching the dead man in the mouth. As Gideon stands, a low hum can be heard for the briefest of moments before it fades as quickly as it came.As you pick up the bow, you feel a deep hum from it when it touches your hand.

462,BeefyChickens,"Demryon puts his hand on Gideon's shoulder as he pushes past ""Stop being an arse, you don't even know how to use it properly"""
463,Nightwing32193,"Gideon sighs deeply and stares off into the distance, not acknowledging Demryon in any way at all, he stands for a few seconds before speaking, his voice cold, grating, void of any sort of friendly tone, ""Get your hand off me. I was the one who killed him, as far as it concerns me, you can fvck right off."" "
464,BeefyChickens,"""Man, daft and stubborn. Or is it that you fantasize having such skill as I do...? I'd invite you to try."" Demryon chuckles."

467,Graehamkracker,"Bendron cares little for their antics. He heads back towards the dead insect and sees if he can bottle some of that acid, or of the beasts chitin might be useful."
468,Nightwing32193,"""Wait, fvck, i still have two arrows in me. Give me a second."" Gideon hands the bow to Demryon and attempts to patch himself up."

472,Dragodar,"As Seamus heals Gideon's wounds, Demryon carefully inspects the bow and Bendron enters the beginning of the tunnel, which is actually quite close to the corpse of the dead man.In the tunnel, Bendron finds Chadwick's sunrod still lying on the ground, illuminating the area around the huge insect, which has stopped twitching. It's ooze is seeping out of it and Bendron is able, with great care, to collect it in his empty bottles.How much do you collect? All 3 bottles worth?You are currently at 36/45 HP.As you pick up the bow, you feel a deep hum from it when it touches your hand. It seems to vibrate for half an instant when you first grasp it, and is ever so slightly warm to the touch. The craftsmanship is flawless, and the grip fits your hand perfectly. It feels weightless and almost like an extension of your very arm. This bow seems to speak to you with a wordless whisper only you can hear."
473,Nightwing32193,"Gideon whispers to Chad,""I know, thank you brother. And yes, yes thats exactly what i woulda done. You think he's as good as he lets on?"""

477,Graehamkracker,"Bendron comes back out of the tunnel, stowing the bottles back in his pack. He sits down where he can watch the contest, and sets to cleaning and honing his halberd."
478,Nightwing32193,"Gideon stands up and nods to Demryon then looks back to Chadwick, ""Fvckin right, brother. Alright lets do this. Pick a tree."""
479,Dragodar,"Bendron soon returns from the tunnel to find Gideon and Demryon arguing over the bow.

485,BeefyChickens,"""Seamus, would you PLEASE help with this awful acid burn! And that would depend on how many you might be asking for, and we'll have to test that some day Gideon"""
486,Dragodar,"Checking the body, the party finds it to be rife with valuables. The black cloak seems to be of a fine soft material, but rather mundane. The man is also wearing studded leather armor; it is sturdy and in good shape but seems to be of average make. The cloth quiver is a standard one, filled with thirty six arrows of average craftsmanship. The amulet around his neck appears valuable at the very least, though something about it says that it is more than just a shiny necklace. The backpack appears at first glance to be empty. When they lift it, it seems to weigh no more than five pounds at the most, but looking inside, they are met with quite a surprise.When they dump the pack, its contents amount to far more than could logically have fit in the bag. First a huge sack of coins falls out with a loud jingle; the sack is almost as large as the backpack itself. After that, a long dagger and a short sword, both of mediocre quality. Following the weapons, a slender, extensible spyglass and a thick coil of sturdy hemp rope. On top of these, a cascade of trail ration packs, numbering about fifteen, spill out onto the ever growing pile. Finally, a heavy but small cloth pouch falls out and lands on top of the mess with a quiet thud. All together, the contents of the bag are far more than could ever have physically fit in it."
487,ButcherDawg,"""Dibs on the bag and the amulet!"""
488,BeefyChickens,"Demryon grabs quickly grabs a dozen arrows from the dead mans quiver and hands the rest to Gideon ""Spare me your coin and take these instead."""
489,ButcherDawg,"Seamus cheerfully runs to Demyron and inspects the acid burn. In a second, his pleased look falls to a disgusted scowl.""This looks gross. I would say worse, even.""roll1d8/roll"
490,BeefyChickens,"""Feels worse than it looks lad! But I'm very thankful for yeh Seamus."" Demryon says with a warm smile"
491,Graehamkracker,"Bendron joins Chadwick in inspecting the amulet, and starts to carefully unwrap the cloth pouch."
492,Dragodar,"(1d8)3 +4Demryon feels the sting of his wounds abate as Seamus heals him. You are currently at 23/31 HP.Bendron and Chadwick stand together, heads bowed low over the amulet as they run it over in their hands and inspect it carefully. It glistens even in the dim light and has a beautiful and mysterious appearance to it. The engravings on it are almost unbelievably fine. Lines thinner than a needle point curve and intertwine upon its surface, forming complex patterns of flourishes and fractals. Neither onlooker can tell what it is or what it does, however.Bendron unwraps the small pouch and finds inside a collection of small curios. Inside the pouch are three milky white pearls, a gold ring studded all around with tiny diamonds, and a walnut sized figurine of a bonsai tree made out of jade and intricately carved with painstaking attention to detail. These items appear very valuable even to the untrained eye.Casting Detect Evil over the corpse, you feel no evil aura. It seems these magic items do not harbor any ill power. It is likely that this man was simply a street bandit who had trained his foul beast to help him rob travelers, and these items were his ill gotten gains. The amulet appears harmless, though undoubtedly magical."
493,Graehamkracker,"""Hm. Looks like a bunch of trinkets. Anyone opposed to hanging on to this amulet until we can see what it is, and then selling the trinkets and splitting the coin at the next town?"""
494,RealZachKraus,"Chadwick takes the amulet quizzically. ""Well it's not cursed, as far as I can tell. I don't know what it's for so I guess we can give it to the kid. Sure is purty though."" Chadwick it to Seamus."
495,ButcherDawg,Seamus looks closely at the amulet to detect magical properties.
496,Nightwing32193,"Gideon inspects the corpse, trying to determine anything he can about their attacker."
497,RealZachKraus,"Chadwick walks up behind Gideon and grabs his shoulders in a startling manner. ""What's the matter, you miss a few molars?"""
498,Dragodar,"The man seems unremarkable, and your best guess is that he was some kind of bandit who trained his foul beast to help him rob travelers and take their possessions. The assortment of valuables appears random, as though stolen from a variety of travelers.Demryon steps forward, reaching for the amulet. ""May I inspect it? I was educated in the properties of magical items, and though I'm no expert, I may be able to recognize something."" Demryon takes the amulet and looks it over carefully for several minutes, turning it over in his hands and examining it from multiple angles.Spellcraft Check: (1d20+3)16After a several moments of silence, Demryon's frown of concentration gives way to a slight smile of satisfaction. He nods and addresses the party. ""I'm almost certain that this is an Amulet of Health. It supernaturally boosts the bodily strength and constitution of its wearer, granting an increase to metabolic resistance to poisons, physical resilience against exhaustion, and overall health and well being.""Demryon holds the amulet aloft for all to see, looking at it with admiration. ""That is, if I'm correct in my guess."" He hands the amulet back to Seamus.The Amulet of Health grants a +2 bonus to the CON score of anyone who wears it for as long as they are wearing it."
499,ButcherDawg,"Seamus rubs his chin. ""Hmmm. So can I have it then?"""
500,Nightwing32193,""" if what the elf says is should I believe I should wear the amulet."""
501,ButcherDawg,"""Well my thought is this... I seem to have the best healing abilities of this group, having just used my spells for others after that attack. It would seem wise to keep me in good health so as to leave my spell casting support for you others."""
502,RealZachKraus,"Chadwick, turns away from Gideon. ""Well let's think about this for a second, who's gotten banged up the most in our group so far?"""
503,ButcherDawg,"Seamus looks to Chadwick, ""What do you say?"""
504,RealZachKraus,"""I say we give it to the biggest glutton for injury we know."" He doesn't NOT look at Bendron.."
505,ButcherDawg,"Seamus also definitely doesn't NOT look at Bendron ""Hmmm... Input..."""
506,RealZachKraus,"Chadwick stoops back over the body, eyeing the leather armor. He pulls the left glove off and slides it onto his bare left hand. ""Eh, doesn't hurt to have a complete pair."""
507,ButcherDawg,"Seamus waits about 2 seconds for Bendron's reply, but then pockets the amulet.Seamus looks into the camera:""This is why my idea to roll dice should have found some ears."""
508,RealZachKraus,"Chadwick look exasperatedly at Gideon, ""Since when did you like wearing jewlery? Let the kid keep it, or give it to the dwarf. If you need protection, take the leather armor. I don't even need the gloves myself."" He takes the glove off of his left hand and extends it to the barbarian."
509,Nightwing32193,"Gideon nods, ""Fine I'll take the bag then. As for the armor, I have no use for it"""
510,ButcherDawg,"Seamus begins walking away with Lou, resuming their journey south. He stops 30 feet away, turns around, and walks back towards the group. ""Okay. Fine."" He tosses the amulet to Gideon and holds his empty hand out for the bag."
511,RealZachKraus,"Chadwick laughs ""Ick, looks like our late friend had the same idea. I'd rather not be weighed down."" He throws it back down."
512,Dragodar,"Having divided the loot amongst themselves, the party returns to the campsite and wearily sleeps off the rest of the night. =============The next morning, the party breaks camp and continues south. Within their first couple hours of walking, they reach the base of the mighty Sudrin Mountains. The slope of the ground begins an ever so gradual rise as they enter the foothills leading to the mountains. The most treacherous part of their journey is about to begin.It is about 10 AM on Tuesday, Iru 9th."
513,RealZachKraus,"As everyone moves along, Chadwick suddenly stops. ""We leave all of the sh!t in the magic bag? Also, I think we should use the money for group supplies. Saves all you hosers fighting over it, yeah?"""
514,Nightwing32193," I'm going to assume that me and the elf are probably the best climbers out of us. How about we go first and tie some lines with Bens rope and have you guys follow us up the more difficult parts?"""
515,Graehamkracker,"Bendron looks up the slope, then around the foothills, trying to recall his knowedge of the area and see if he remembers any easier passes."
516,Dragodar,"So far, the topography of the land is different enough that it appears unfamiliar to Bendron. Once he gets further into the mountains, that may change, but for now the sight before his eyes is foreign.The party continues their trek through the foothills. The air grows colder and thinner as they steadily gain altitude. Soon, they feel the crunch of frozen grass under their feet. Though there is no snow yet, the frost covered blades of grass crack with a cold crispiness under the heavy boots of the fellowship. As the companions make their way higher and higher into the mountains, the forest landscape behind them falls away into a vast portrait of green and brown. The ground grows rockier as vegetation grows sparse. Within an hour, they have reached the snowline. A thin layer of crunchy white lays like a blanket across the stones in front of them.It is almost noon on Tuesday, Iru 9th."
517,RealZachKraus,"""I have rope too, and there's another in the magic pack. If this is indeed the will of the fellowship, I will see it done."" He reaches his bare left hand into his pack and pulls out a 20 foot length of rope."
518,Graehamkracker,"""Think we can make it over today, or should we rest here?"""
519,RealZachKraus,"""It's only aboot noon, eh, we can get a start through this pass."" Chadwick points his armored hand into a saddle in the mountains."
520,Graehamkracker,"""Alright then. Lets do it."" Bendron pushes on, using the halberd as a walking staff."
521,RealZachKraus,"""Let's rock and roll boys!"""
522,Nightwing32193,"Gideon leaves all of his weapons, save his dagger, and gear in Chadwick's care. Wrapping the rope around his torso he begins to climb."
523,Dragodar,"The party continues into the mountains. Very rapidly, the temperature drops and the air grows thin. The adventurers begin to find it difficult to breath, and their fingers and toes grow numb.For over two hours, the party pushes deeper into the mountains, their altitude constantly rising. Soon the shivering party find themselves surrounded on three sides by sheer cliff face. The pass they've been following leads back for over a mile, and the discouraged group realizes that they will have to backtrack.With a sudden flash of realization, you recall this particular basin. If your memory serves you correctly, there is an entrance somewhere among these rocks. From what you remember, it's somewhere on your left, on the eastern cliff face."

526,Graehamkracker,"Bendron keep searching: ""There's an entrance here. Probably hidden. Should be this side. If its still here."""
527,Dragodar,"Demryon begins to search the rock wall, listening carefully to Bendron's instructions as he makes his thorough examination.<i>Search modifier +11Bendron's familiarity with the area +4Search Check: (1d20+15)29Demryon explores the wall meticulously where Bendron tells him too, and after almost ten minutes of careful inspection, cries out in delight. ""Look here, dwarf!"" He points at a plain looking spot on the wall. He blows on it hard, causing a small amount of dust to dislodge. Looking closely, Bendron can see a paper thin crack going straight up and down in the solid rock. It is too straight to be a natural formation."
528,Graehamkracker,"""There we are!"" Bendron works with Demryon to brush off all the dust and snow."
529,Dragodar,"After a few moments of fastidious scraping and dusting, the vague outline of a large arched door is barely visible in the mountainside. Even after being cleared of dust, debris, and snow, the lines are so thin that it is easy to lose sight of them. If not for knowing already where it was, it would be easily possible to lose track of the door once again even after cleaning up the edges.Directly in the center crack, between the two doors, is the shallowest circular depression, so shallow that it could very easily be missed by a careless eye.Yundri doors were enchanted with a different entry mode every day. Bendron does not know what the last pass code on this door was, since he was put into stasis before the final decline of his people. However, a Yundri clan signet ring pressed into the center of the door would reveal enchanted runes that would provide a clue to the current entry mode."
530,Graehamkracker,"Once the door is completely revealed, Bendron presses his ring into the door."
531,Dragodar,"When Bendron presses his ring into the mountainside, there is an immediate change in the plain stone doors. Heavyset runes suddenly protrude from the stone, as though being pressed through soft material from the other side. The blocky dwarven lettering remains on the stone even after Bendron pulls his ring away. They are in an unfamiliar language which the party does not recognize.The runes are in Ancient Dwarven and translate to:<i>I love to fall but cannot climb,Though I run smoother than any rhyme. I own less money than a monk, Though I travel the globe and am constantly drunk."
532,RealZachKraus,"""Again, HOLY SH!T let's not go in here."""
533,Graehamkracker,"""Here is the one place in this world that I know. Let's see how much has changed.""Bendron speaks into the rock: Dŵr"
534,Dragodar,"The doors remain stubbornly closed.It is about 3 PM on Tuesday, Iru 9th."
535,Graehamkracker,"Bendron clears his throat and speaks again: ""Dẁr"""
536,Dragodar,Only the howling of the cold wind breaks the silence. The party waits as the icy air nips at their noses and ears.
537,RealZachKraus,"Chadwick pronounces his words carefully and slowly... ""LET'S. MOVE. ON,"" his bare left hand blistering in the cold."
538,RealZachKraus,"Chadwick waves that same hand at Bendron, ""What are we waiting for, Bendron? What do these runes mean?"""
539,Graehamkracker,"Bendron reads: ""I love to fall but cannot climb,Though I run smoother than any rhyme. I own less money than a monk, Though I travel the globe and am constantly drunk."""
540,RealZachKraus,"Chadwick looks at Bendron, his abhorrence for the underground trumped by the need to find shelter, ""I assume the word you were saying was 'water' or 'river' or some sh!t? And that wasn't it?"""
541,Graehamkracker,"""Aye."" Bendron grunts"
542,RealZachKraus,"""Night falls, but it doesn't run.. a stitch can run, but it doesn't fall... For FVCKS SAKE"" Chad says absentmindedly."
543,RealZachKraus,"""night falls, snow falls, rain falls, fvcking leaves fall, it's stupid."""
544,Nightwing32193,"Gideon rolls his eyes, ""Fvck you prissy mvtherfvckers. Stand back!""  Gideon strides up to the door and puts his hands on the door the Bendron found, ""Jacen. Father. Give me strength."" with those words, Gideon thrusts his fist into the small circular depression where Bendron tried to put his ring."
545,RealZachKraus,"Chadwick rolls his eyes, ""yeah that's it.."""
546,Dragodar,"A shock of blinding pain shoots up Gideon's arm as his knuckles and wrist shatter on impact. Searing pain envelops Gideon's consciousness, erasing all thoughts from his mind as he clutches his arm in agony. Gideon takes 10 points of damage and his arm is broken and completely unusable. Natural healing (waiting to regain HP overnight) will take at the very least a month and a half to heal, possibly significantly more. Magical or divine healing can repair the broken bones.The doors remain adamantly shut, unmoving and unchanged, seemingly mocking the party for their fruitless efforts. Not a dent or scratch marks the doors. The only indicator that Gideon punched them are the screams of anger and pain that echo through the canyon."
547,Nightwing32193,"Gideon lets out multiple strings of curses, some in common, some in Ul Vadr as he clutches his arm. Regretting his decision in the worst way."
548,RealZachKraus,"Chadwick is just about done with eveything that's happening right now. ""Now let us in!"""
549,Dragodar,"The water immediately soaks into the door as though the stone itself is thirstily drinking it, and in an instant has completely disappeared, leaving the rock looking bone dry as before.With a loud grating sound, the doors swing gradually outward, crushing small rocks and plants as they scrape loudly across the ground. After a few brief moments, they stand fully open, revealing the yawning black maw that is the entrance to the kingdom of the Yundri.The party stares in awe at the massive stone steps hewn directly out of the stone, descending into the heart of the mountain. The light of the late afternoon illuminates the first few yards into the stairwell, and beyond that is blackness."
550,Nightwing32193,"""what?! Are you fvcking kidding me?! Mvtherfvcking piece of sh!t!"" cries Gideon, mostly out of shock, but also in immense pain."
551,RealZachKraus,"Chadwick sighs, all hope that he had been wrong fading away.. ""Let's just go in,"" he says, brushing his hair back with his unarmored left hand."
552,Graehamkracker,Bendron heads into the dark
553,ButcherDawg,"""Do we need a light source? I can cast a spell."""
554,Dragodar,"The party plunges into the darkness. They descend about a hundred steps, penetrating further and further into the mountainside, before the stairs end and they find themselves standing in front of large wooden double doors. The metalworking on the hinges is in the classic blocky style of the dwarves."
555,Graehamkracker,Bendron doesn't slow as he tries to pull the doors open and stroll on through.
556,ButcherDawg,"""Oh no! Please, oh please Seamus! We didn't mean to ignore you! It is so very dark in here and we would absolutely love for you to cast that light spell. We didn't answer because we were left speechless by your immense generosity and power!"" Seamus rolls his eyes, ""Mokay... fine.""Seamus casts Light spell."
557,Nightwing32193,"Gideon applauds, then winces, as he remembers his broken arm."
558,Dragodar,"Seamus illuminates the blade of his scythe, casting golden light around the cave. Bendron rushes through the doors and into the room beyond. The massive oaken doors swing open easily. The quality of their construction makes them feel far lighter than they are. The wood appears to have hardly aged at all, so expertly treated it was during the creation of the doors. Inside, a large entrance chamber splays out in front of them, grandiose and majestic, as is the way of the dwarven people."
559,Nightwing32193,"Gideon nudges Chadwick and whispers,""You got any healing left for my dumbass?"""
560,Graehamkracker,Bendron spares a few quick glances towards the walls as he marches through the room.
561,ButcherDawg,"""Ummm... so. Where is everybody, Bendron?"""
562,Graehamkracker,"""Likely dead for eons. We were driven back underground for shelter when the storms came, and over time each of the <i>Kodulinn were buried when the mountains fell or starved after we could no longer escape."" "
563,RealZachKraus,"""Well that's a real kick in the knackers. Think there's any booby traps we need to be made aware of?"""
564,ButcherDawg,"""Oh! Are we looking for treasure?!"""
565,Graehamkracker,"""Wouldn't be surprised. There were plenty who thrived at our fall - mostly goblins and others from deeper. But any here shouldn't be unlike the ones we had at <i>Síðast Veyinn"
566,ButcherDawg,"""So is there anything specific we are looking for? Or just wandering around?"""
567,Graehamkracker,"""And boy, anything here belongs to the Yundri, not to you."""
568,ButcherDawg,"""Sounds like Yundri needs to learn how to share!"""
569,Dragodar,"Bendron rushes forward. On either side, lining the walls, huge twelve foot statues of dwarven warriors holding giant double sided battleaxes stand shoulder to shoulder. On the other side of the entrance hall are three wide, shallow stone steps leading up to a dias, behind which is a short hallway with another set of large oaken double doors at the end.Through these doors, the corridor descends sharply into another staircase, split in the middle by a brief landing. Lou begins to whine nervously, unused to being underground. The dim illumination of Seamus' spell casts flickering light and dancing shadows onto the walls around them.At the bottom of the staircase, two corridors branch off in either direction to the right and left, and just beyond them is a massive chamber, significantly bigger than the entrance room and with a much taller ceiling. Thick pillars line this hall in two even rows, with five pillars to each row. In sharp contrast to the meticulously calculated right angles and detailed proportions of typical dwarven craftsmanship, the floor is uneven and rough, as though liquid stone was accidentally spilled from a giant bucket all across the floor, and then cooled, leaving an ugly, irregular mess.All around the room are broken down wooden carts and stalls, centuries old and rotting. The remnants of former life litter the place -- though there are no bodies to be seen, just abandoned possessions and junk.Open doorways line the walls, four on either side of the hall, behind the pillars. Another large set of double doors stand on the other side, all the way across the room.You recognize this as the Trade Hall of Dorôwil, the main public hub in the Yundri city of Dorôwil. It is here that much of the trade and the majority of public relation with the outside world took place, or at least began. This was once a scene of great jollity and lucrative business, but now it lies cold and dead. Your dwarven eyes immediately recognize the uneven floor as a cooled magma leak. Some disaster must have struck this place long ago."
570,Nightwing32193,"Gideon gingerly rummages around the junk, trying to find something to fashion a makeshift sling out of."
571,Dragodar,"Anything made of cloth or wood seems to have rotted into nothing since it was last touched. Gideon does however, find a collection of leather straps and bindings that, although they seem to be experiencing moderate dry rot, are relatively sturdy compared to anything else he can find. As long as he doesn't put them under considerable strain, they should be able to hold his arm up."
572,Nightwing32193,"After some trying he fashions a support system for his broken arm. He then draws his short sword with his off hand and swings it around at the air. After a few cuts he feels satisfied with the blade and continues forward with the group, sword still drawn in his left hand."
573,Graehamkracker,Bendron keeps moving to the door across the room
574,RealZachKraus,"Chadwick looks over at Gideon, smirking, ""Hey maybe if you get rid of those gross trophies of yours I could fix your arm. Just not feeling very powerful right now."""
575,Nightwing32193,"Gideon sighs. After looking up at the ceiling for a few seconds, he cracks a smile. Shaking his head he removes a pouch from his belt and tosses it to Chadwick, ""You haven't given up yet? Have you brother?"""
576,RealZachKraus,"Chadwick smiles, ""Nope."" He takes the pouch and lays his unarmored hand on Gideons arm. Fusing back together bone and flesh alike."
577,Nightwing32193,"Gideon immediately drops to the ground and does five quick pushups, just to be sure. Getting back to his feet, he embraces Chadwick,""I'm once again in your debt."""
578,Dragodar,These doors do not budge. They seem to be firmly locked and immovable.Chadwick expends 10 points of LoH to heal Gideon's arm.
579,RealZachKraus,"""Naw bud we're alright."" The two friends low bones."
580,Graehamkracker,"Bendron heads to his left, to one of the openings along the wall."
581,Nightwing32193,"""Try your holy water again on those door, Chad."""
582,Dragodar,Several different corridors branch out in various directions. The light of Seamus' scythe illuminates the hallways in either direction.
583,Graehamkracker,"Bendron heads down the hallways, looking for a larger room.there's the vertical hallway right by seamis. That one"
584,Dragodar,"The narrow corridor widens. There are double doors on the left, and a single door on the right. Next to the single door, another corridor branches off to the right and opens into two wider hallways.A slight scuffling noise can be heard down the hallway to the left; some kind of movement.You recall that the Yundri had a railcar system in the mines that spanned a vast area under the mountains. If you could reach it, it may be able to take you to the south side of the range very quickly. It would be on the lowest level of Dorôwil, under the rest of the city."
585,Graehamkracker,"""We need to look for a way down, through the mines. They've probably been closed off, and may be overrun, but they'll be the fastest way through the mountains. Should be somewhere beneath the rest of <i>Dorôwil."
586,Dragodar,"When the party turns the corner, the scuffling sound becomes louder. As the light from Seamus' scythe illuminates the room, half a dozen horrifyingly large rats look up in unison, their eyes glowing bright yellow in the reflection of the scythe. With a clamor of squeals and shrieks, they rush the party, their lithe ratlike movements all the more awful due to their size.Each rat is nearly two feet high at the shoulder, and over six feet long including their tails.

The other three rats continue to forage, ignoring the party.On the other side of the room, there is a wide staircase leading upwards. There are several other entrances to the room around the perimeter.You recognize this large room as the guest chambers. If you recall correctly, several of these doors lead to visitor bedrooms which used to house guests of Dorôwil."
593,Graehamkracker,"""There should be some beds nearby, in case we need to return to rest. But for now, we may want to keep looking for a way down - perhaps those stairs?"" Bendron wanders the room to check the status of the nearby rooms and the hall the stairs lead to."
594,Dragodar,"Bendron rushes up the stairs, and the party follows. Each landing he reaches leads to another staircase, always moving upward. After the first two sets of stairs they begin to smell fresh air. By the time they reach the fourth, there is a significant amount of cooled magma impeding his passage, and the fifth is completely covered. After clambering over the jagged igneous deposit, they reach a wide chamber with a long, thin opening in the mountainside. A long gap in the rock, about seventy feet long and four feet tall, allows a view of the outside world. The window is narrow enough to remain hidden from external view, and the mountainside overhangs outside it like an awning, providing cover from above. It is totally concealed from the outside world.Sunlight streams in, the first that the party has seen in what feels like hours. The sun is low in the western sky, and from the overlook, they have a wide view of the mountains. Other than the gorgeous vista, this route seems like a dead end, so the party heads back to the guest chambers, where they investigate several of the rooms. Any bedding and furniture has long since rotted away over the centuries, but the rooms are relatively comfortable and safe looking, as dwarven doors seem to have stood the test of time quite well.It is just after 5 PM on Tuesday, Iru 9th."
595,Graehamkracker,Bendron heads to explore the hallway between the two rooms they've discovered
596,Dragodar,"The hallway is a set of stairs leading further down into the darkness. As the party descends, the musty smell of damp reaches their nostrils and the air grows noticeably more humid, but also cooler. While the first level was relatively dry and smelled of little more than dust, this deeper level has a moist feeling and a faintly sour smell of rust and rot.You recall that the second level of Dorôwil was where the elders lived. It was typically the most heavily guarded level and had the most locked doors and private meeting rooms. The second level was also home to the Great Hall, which was the massive main gathering area for ambassadors of other races and for political events. Dorôwil was run from this second level.There is a closed door on the party's left, and an open doorway on the right. Beyond these, the hall ends in a T intersection, with two corridors branching off in either direction, left and right."
597,Graehamkracker,"""Great hall should be around here somewhere"" Bendron calls over his shoulder as he picks a direction and keeps walking. Down, then left"
598,Dragodar," Bendron leads the party forward, and they quickly find the next staircase down, but before they descend, they notice the doorway to a large cavernous room. It is difficult to tell how big it is exactly, but a distinct feeling of openness comes from the doorway. Bendron ventures through the doorway, followed by the party. Seamus raises his scythe, saying, ""Let me risk a little more light..."" and the great hall of Dorôwil is revealed.The enormous cavern is nearly a hundred feet across in either direction, with a towering domed ceiling just as high. The most amazing part of the structure is that not a single support pillar stands in the room, and the weight of the gigantic arched ceiling is supported completely by the perimeter walls.The rotted remnants of long feast tables and hundreds of chairs litter the ground. Weathered tapestries line the walls, almost completely faded and mostly dissolved. Giant statues stand in every corner of the room, ancient sentinels standing guard over a long dead people."
599,Graehamkracker,"Bendron wanders the room, eventually returning to the best preserved tapestry. ""I need to take this"""
600,Dragodar,"Bendron finds the most intact tapestry he can and gently pulls it down from the wall. It flutters gracefully toward the floor, falling slowly and silently, almost with a sort of solemnity, as though paying tribute to the fall of the dwarven people themselves. It alights softly in Bendron's hands, as he delicately catches it before it can hit the ground. Approximately five by five feet, the piece which Bendron holds is a small fragment of the whole, a mere vestige of the masterpiece that once was. On it, in faded colors but woven expertly with the finest threads and tenderest care, is a scene of bitter sadness. Dozens of dwarves stand around a collapsing mountain under a dark and clouded sky, using ancient magics in a vain attempt to prevent its collapse. Despite the best efforts of the geomancers to call upon the powers of earth and stone for their salvation, the mountain is crumbling, to their utter despondency.Although it portrays but a single moment of a greater scene, the tapestry captures the plight of the dwarves in its very essence. Their adamant resolve, their valiant attempt to deny fate, their calamitous failure to do so, their anguished despair at the result. The black clouds in the sky whip and lash at the dwarves with furious wind and stinging rain as the heroes seek to preserve their dynasty, while the unbearable weight of destiny crushes them slowly under its heel.A heavy silence hangs in the air as Bendron gazes with bowed head at the picture in his hands.You recognize the mountain in the scene as Orodŵr, the peak that stood over the great city of Beghdarohm. This tapestry recounts the demise of the first of the Yundri cities to fall. With a pang, you realize that this must have been woven after the fall of Beghdarohm, but before the fall of Dorôwil. Those who wove it must have been blissfully unaware of their own impending doom as they mourned the loss of their sister city and the brethren who fell with her."
601,Nightwing32193,"""I don't like it here. Too quiet. Too dead. Lets keep moving."" "
602,Graehamkracker,"""Can I put this in there for safe-keeping?"""
603,Nightwing32193,"Gideon looks at the tapestry, ""I mean, I guess. As long as it won't just turn to dust."" He opens the bag and offers it to Bendron."
604,Graehamkracker,"""Its lasted this long, I trust it will be safe until I can find a way to preserve it"" Bendron reaches in and pulls out the dagger and sword before stowing the tapestry."
605,Nightwing32193,"""I admire your want to preserve your heritage dwarf, I'll do my best to keep it safe."""
606,Graehamkracker,"""Perhaps I may yet see what your friend does"" Bendron replies, tucking the two blades into his own pack as he turns to walk through the rest of the room and surrounding halls, looking for anything else worth salvaging before heading deeper."
607,Nightwing32193,"Gideon chuckles, ""Perhaps. Not likely."""
608,Dragodar,"Returning to the staircase they had found earlier, the party descends yet again. There is more jagged rock on these stairs, contrasting sharply with the smoothly hewn walls and floor. Again, the appearance of liquid rock, spilled and then cooled, is apparent on the uneven steps.The air grows even moister as they head further down, and the sour smell significantly more pungent. A faint dripping sound can be heard in the distance, though with no discernible direction. The temperature, however, stays fairly stable, not dropping as it did when they went from the first to the second level; it seems to have reached a comfortable constant. As they continue to plumb the depths of the mountain, a claustrophobic awareness of the stone above their heads begins to sink upon the party. The sheer physical mass and density of the mountain above them seems to depress their spirits, causing their voices to sound thinner and weaker, and making the light of Seamus' scythe appear dim and feeble.<i>DC to beat: 10Demryon: (1d20+2)12Seamus: (1d20+8)17Gideon: (1d20+0)9Chadwick: (1d20+3)18Lou:(1d20+1)6Gideon and Lou in particular seem affected by their close quarters and lack of fresh air. They become noticeably shaken as they move further down the stairs. Each steep stairway between levels has brought them down over a hundred feet deeper into the ground. With each step, Lou whines with discomfort, staying close to Seamus and tucking her tail between her legs. Gideon feels himself break into a cold sweat as he continues to go down.Gideon is  for 10 rounds, and must make another Will save after 10 rounds to determine if he gets over the fear."
609,Nightwing32193,"""I really don't like this. Who's fvcking idea to pass under the mountain was this anyway? Its not right for men to be this far under earth."" he wipes his brow with the cloth bound around his wrist and begins fiddling nervously with his dagger."
610,Graehamkracker,"""I remember someone saying they were  'loath, whatever that means, to leave land' and was more than happy to escape the snow. Bendron says as he heads down the hallway on his right."
611,Nightwing32193,"""Fvck off Ben, I was content to climb over, not go under!"""
612,Dragodar,"At the end of the hallway, the party is faced with many choices. There is a large pair of double doors at the end of the hall, and two smaller sets of double doors on either side. There are also several other doors along the hallway, as well as additional corridors leading in various directions, off into the darkness."
613,Graehamkracker,Bendron goes to open the large double doors
614,Dragodar,"The huge doors are heavy, but swing open easily on their well made hinges. On the other side, the party is met with a wondrous sight. A massive cavern, over two hundred feet long and over a hundred feet wide, sprawls out in front of them. Unlike the other rooms they have been in, however, this huge chamber does not appear to have been artificially created at all. It is a natural cavity in the mountain, huge and unaltered. The high ceiling is over forty feet above them, and sparkles in the light of Seamus's scythe like the inside of a gargantuan geode, sending dancing flecks of purple and blue light scattering across the floor. All over the cavern floor lie ancient and abandoned training materials. Training dummies, old targets, empty cracked beer steins, and carts full of weapons and armor are scattered across the ground. Almost all organic material such as wood and cloth has completely rotted away, leaving only the metal and stone parts remaining. The sour smell of rust is strongest in this cavern, and it is joined by a faint smell of decay, as though underground animals have lived and died in this cave. The sound of running water can be heard, though its direction is impossible to discern.The sparkling quartz ceiling gives the whole chamber a magical feel, and diffuses the white light of Seamus' scythe across the entire area, giving it a soft purple hue. The sour smell is mildly unpleasant, but not so strong as to be unbearable. The constant dripping and distant rush of water gives the cavern a calm and peaceful atmosphere. The rough stone floor, much unlike the smoothly polished halls they so recently tread, feels natural and coarse, and a thin layer of some kind of pale subterranean moss grows across it, soft and spongy like a giant carpet thrown across the floor.Further down, away from the doors through which the party entered, there seems to be some kind of elliptical pit or hole in the ground, almost forty feet across.Though you have not been inside them before, you recognize the Training Caves of Dorôwil from stories you've heard. This level of the city must be the military level, where the dwarven warriors lived and trained. If your memory serves you correctly, the famed Forges of Dorôwil are also on this level, massive furnaces, smelters, and anvils from which were produced some of the greatest works of Yundri engineering. The pit in the distance is likely a training pit, and was probably used as a contained combat zone for the dwarven soldiers."
615,Nightwing32193,"Gideon's jaw involuntarily drops slightly as he takes in his new surroundings. He looks at Bendron,""By Kord, I've never seen the likes of this before. Perhaps going underground wasn't the worst after all. Godsdamn, this is full of beauty."""
616,Graehamkracker,"""The mountain has it's gifts. There ought to be a forge around here too."" Bendron searches through the weapons and pit to see if anything catches his eye"
617,Dragodar,"Most of the weapons are rusted beyond usability, but even those that aren't have no grips or scabbards, as everything has rotted away. The vast majority of the weapons and armor are essentially junk, though they could be derusted and reforged into usable weapons by a good blacksmith.As Bendron is looking through the rubble and debris, Seamus' scythe dims for a moment, and then blinks out. However, the party is not enveloped in total darkness. The ceiling of the cave seems to produce some kind of luminescence of its own. Though it is very dim lighting, and heavy, dark shadows obscure all corners and nooks of the cave, the soft purple glow is enough to see by, and the party is able to maneuver through the debris without tripping.Approaching the pit, the party is able to hear a soft, wet sound coming from within; it almost resembles the slurping gulp of a pig eating slop, and carries with it a certain ugliness that nobody can quite put their finger on. Looking over the edge of the pit, the group can see that it is about twelve feet deep. Bones of all shapes and sizes are littered around the floor of the pit, and in the purple shadows of the cave, they can see a vague shape moving near the center. The pit is too deeply immersed in shadow to clearly make out what is down there, but it seems to be preoccupied with something in one place, not moving around.With your elven low light vision, you are able to see a reptilian creature hunched over with its back to you. Its body is fairly round and about eight feet in diameter. From its back, three large tentacles -- one from each flank and one from the middle of the spine, like a tail -- wrap around in front of it so you can't see the ends of them. It seems to be eating at the moment, and has not noticed you.With your darkvision, you are able to see a reptilian creature hunched over with its back to you.

With disgust, the party realizes that there are no eyes on the creature's broad skull, but as it raises its tentacles, this anomaly is quickly explained. The two tentacles extending from the creature's sides are tipped with nasty looking sharp barbs, while the one in the middle contains nearly half a dozen eyes, which blink and move independently.The hideous beast springs forward with the agility of a cat, leaping up the side of the pit with total ease. In two quick bounds, the monster is out of the pit and standing in front of the party, its tentacles swaying slightly as it crouches low, prepared to attack.Demryon: (1d20+9)18Seamus: (1d20+3)13Lou: (1d20+3)10Gideon: (1d20+3)7Bendron: (1d20+2)16Chadwick: (1d20+2)9Monster: (1d20+4)14The beast is about eight feet across, not counting its tentacles, and looks to be over 500 pounds, but moves with terrifying agility."

625,Dragodar,"The monster shudders under the impact of Bendon's mighty blow. Huge though it is, it is staggered by the force behind the strike. Though Bendron's attack successfully draws blood, it seems to infuriate the creature all the more, causing it to shift its attention from the elf to the dwarf. Thick, dark blood oozes from the wound inflicted by Bendron's halberd, but the beast instantly regains its footing and lunges forward at Bendorn, its razor sharp, barbed tentacles lashing out with lightning speed.Tentacle 1 Attack: (1d20+4)12Tentacle 2 Attack: (1d20+4)21Tentacle 1 Damage: (1d8)4Tentacle 2 Damage: (1d8)5Bendron nimbly dodges one of the tentacles, but their blistering speed proves too much to handle and the second one catches him squarely in the chest, slashing across the few unarmored places on his body and briefly knocking the wind out of him.You are now at 38/43 HP.Seamus is already stepping up with a spell in hand. With a few strange motions from his fingers and a couple words muttered under his breath, Seamus pulls his hands apart as though tearing a piece of fabric in front of him. The very air in front of him seems to rip apart, opening a hole in space and revealing what appears to be a dark night sky shimmering with thousands of tiny stars. From this hole in the air leaps a massive creature, seemingly a mix between a horse and an eagle, some strange chimaera of the two. The otherworldly creature has the head of an eagle and sports a massive pair of feathered wings, but has the body of a horse and is roughly the same size as its equine counterpart. It bears powerful talons on its forelegs, and heavy hooves on its rear legs. In one fluid motion, it bounds forth from its starry genesis directly onto the ugly creature facing the party. It tears at the reptilian monstrosity with its razor sharp talons, taking the beast entirely by surprise. Even as this creature leaps forth, the rift in space closes behind it, leaving no indication of the star filled ocean behind it.Talons Attack: (1d20+6)17Talons Damage: (1d4+4)6Despite the foul monster's terrifying speed, the hippogriff is quick enough to land a few nasty rakes with its talons. The monster is bleeding more noticeably now, and is getting more agitated and angry. It lets out a deep, guttural, reptilian cry that echoes loudly through the chamber and down the surrounding tunnels. To everyone's shock, the sound is somehow intelligible. As the roar echoes through the chamber, everyone hears a distinct thought pass through their brains, one certainly not born of their own minds. The thought is not in the form of a word or phrase, but rather an emotion, a powerful feeling that everyone understands despite not knowing how: Lou immediately follows up with her own attack, leaping forward with a snarl and biting at the beast with her fangs.Bite Attack: (1d20+3)16Bite Damage: (1d6+1)4Aiming for one of its tentacles, Lou barely misses as the creature nimbly pulls its appendage away from her snapping jaws.<u>Bendron: Stance of Clarity (-/-) rounds, Leading Attack (1/1) rounds: Summon Nature's Ally II (1/3) roundsGideon</li></ol>"

627,Dragodar,"As you cast out with your holy power to feel for an aura, you are met with a definite sense of evil. This creature is intelligent enough to choose to be malevolent, and certainly is. It is no demon, but it is evil enough to feel the wrath of Hyroneus.Chadwick concentrates hard, reaching out with his heart and praying to his god to help him discern the nature of this beast.Gideon</li></ol>"

Bringing his massive sword down in a mighty arc, he attempts to cleave into his opponent, but his weapon strikes only air. A rock catches the barbarian's foot at the last moment, throwing him off balance just enough to cause his strike to go awry. The creature is also deceptively agile for its short, squat body.As the monster dodges Gideon's strike, the party sees something that sends chills down their spines. From one of the many tunnels behind the training pit, another tentacled beast emerges at a sprint, barreling toward the melee at full tilt.Demryon quickly releases an arrow at the beast, desperate to slow its charge.<i>+9 RAB+1 misc+4 Bendron's Leading AttackAttack: (1d20+14)23<i>+1 miscDamage: (1d8+1)7The arrow strikes the beast neatly, just under its massive, gaping, slobbering maw, embedding in its flesh but not slowing its approach.

The other tentacle wraps around the hippogriff's neck and squeezes, choking the summoned ally.

Bendron feels the satisfying crunch of bone, then yanks his halberd out with a mighty tug, sending dark blood spraying in every direction.

As he lifts the enormous weapon over his head, Hyroneus hears the prayer and responds with immediacy to his favored son. Suddenly, the entire metal head of the axe glows with a blinding white brilliance. Chadwick brings the axe down upon the foul creature in front of him, and the razor sharp edge smashes directly into its open mouth, severing its lower jaw completely. As the blade makes contact, the axe flashes brighter than the sun for half an instant, and then goes out, leaving a residual afterglow in the eyes of all who beheld it.The creature wails in hideous agony, and a reverberating feeling of excruciating pain echoes in the mind of the party. Though it does not die, the beast is completely disoriented by the agonizing pain inflicted by Chad's harrowing blow. It stumbles backwards, its incredible agility suddenly a thing of the past.

The wounded beast makes a dash for the tunnel, rounding the bend and disappearing from view into the darkness. It's companion lets out a loud bellow, and a psychic message of indignation blasts through the minds of the party. Though the message is purely emotion and carries no words, it would loosely translate to Common as: ""<i>WHAT THE FÛCK BRO""Seamus wastes no time slashing at the remaining monster with his sickle.Attack: (1d20+2)16Damage: (1d6-1)4Once again Seamus' attack is unsuccessful, but fortunately his summoned Hippogriff follows him up with a more impressive display.

650,RealZachKraus,"""THAT FVCKER'S MINE!"" Chadwick roars as he follows after Bendron, eager to finish what he started."
651,Nightwing32193,Gideon follows after Chad and Bendron. Not keen about being left alone in the underground caves.
652,Dragodar,"The party follows after the monster, into the dark tunnel. As they leave the training grounds, the purple glow fades behind them, and they enter total darkness. The blackness swallows them up, so smothering that they can almost feel it on their skin. Gideon waves his hand in front of his face, completely unable to see it."
653,Graehamkracker,"Bendron explores the mouths of each of the tunnels, hoping to see if there's any blood trails or if they lead anywhere that looks promising."
654,Nightwing32193,"""Uh, Chad? Ben? Anyone have a light?"" Gideon feels cold begin to collect on his body."
655,RealZachKraus,"Chadwick reaches into his pack with his unarmored hand and pulls out a fresh torch and his flint. After a few tries he manages to strike a flame and before long a dull glow plays upon the walls. The harrowed, blood-covered faces of the companions ghastly take on a ghastly in the flickering light. ""I'll stay to the rear, just in case. Bendron, keep us on track, he sighs, reluctantly letting the party pass him."
656,Dragodar,"Demryon searches for any sign of the fleeing beast, while the rest of the party helps him look.Demryon Survival Check: (1d20+7)19Even with his sharply honed tracking skills, Demryon has little luck. After exploring several of the mouths of the tunnels, it is unclear which way the monster fled. The floor of the cave is wet here, with a couple millimeters of water glistening on the smooth stone floor, so any trace of the beast's blood has been washed away. The water is moving, but downhill seems to be in several directions at once, and it is hard to determine which way the water is flowing. The close quarters of the tunnels cause the flame of Chadwick's torch to feel stifling and oppressive. A slight reduction in oxygen here causes an almost imperceptible difficulty in breathing, and the party finds themselves gulping deeper breaths of air as they begin to feel ever so slightly out of breath.The cave system seems to grow complex and unpredictable at this point, far different from the mathematical and ordered halls of the dwarf stronghold. The tunnels weave about in random directions, shrinking from comfortably wide to impossibly narrow without warning. To delve too deeply into the natural caverns would be extremely dangerous for anyone not highly experienced in spelunking. Getting lost is the main risk, but sudden cliffs and dropoffs, tight squeezes, unexpected drops in temperature, poisonous fungi and plantlife, dangerous animals, and unknown diseases are all very real dangers of crawling too far underground without the proper preparation."
657,Graehamkracker,"""Looks like it may have gotten away. We could backtrack and look for the forges at this depth, or head back up towards the great hall if we's rather get some rest. I'd imagine that the more opulent rooms are back up that way - we may be able to find something akin to homes or estates. I would hazard a guess that there's some non-Yundri treasures up there that I wouldn't mind you liberating, boy."" Bendron eyes Seamus with the last sentence, but aims it at the others as well."
658,Dragodar,"""What do you guys think? Press on or go back for some sleep?""Chad's torch flickers, sending capricious shadows dancing along the moist cave walls. A steady dripping is audible in the background, and the tight acoustics of the small cave they're in make Seamus' voice sound muted and soft. The cave smells faintly of vague dampness, in addition to the burning of Chad's torch. The air is heavy, stale and humid."
659,Nightwing32193,"""I don't want to spend anymore time then I have to down here."" "
660,Graehamkracker,"""Then we may as well keep moving."" Bendron backtracks towards the stairs, hoping to find the forges and a way down."
661,Dragodar,"Bendron leads the group out of the constricting passage and back through the glowing training field. Chad's torch plays with the purple light of the ceiling as they make their way back to the dwarven halls. Soon, the party is through the double doors and walking back down the corridor toward the stairs. Bendron passes the stairs and turns left, turning to one of the doors that line the hall and shoving it wide open.Although it seems to be becoming a pattern, the party is still not quite accustomed to the vast open spaces that the dwarves are capable of creating underground. This chamber is the largest they've seen so far, even bigger than the Great Hall. On their left, doors line the walls, with three giant smelting pots alternating between them and four wide, squat metalworking tables in the middle of the floor. To the right, five enormous forges line the walls, attached to massive, long-cold furnaces built into the walls. Two rows of steel anvils stand side by side like soldiers in formation, numbering ten altogether.As they look upon this wondrous sight, the party can almost hear the hiss of the smelters and the clanking of the smithy's hammers from an era long past. This room was once the central hub for Yundri engineering. Now, it sits cold and dead, like the rest of Dorôwil.Past the smithing equipment, near the end of the room, two wide staircases lead downward toward each other, ever further into the heart of the mountain."
662,Graehamkracker,"Bendron checks the adjoining and nearby rooms for a forgotten stockpile, barracks, or something similar."
663,Dragodar,"Searching through the adjacent rooms, the party finds little of interest. Most materials seems to have rotted away over the centuries. There are many remnants of weapons and armor in storage, but nothing is usable without significant repairs or restoration.Bendron turns back to the forge room and makes his way down the wide stone steps as the party follows him. The room below is the same size as the forge room, but is nearly half full of huge chunks of shot rock, the untouched remnants of unrefined ore. In the center of the room, a wide metal platform hangs from a complex structure made of metal and stone. On the platform rests a small pile of the shot rock. It appears to have been some kind of lift, a giant dumbwaiter of sorts for transporting raw ore to this storage room, from the mines below. Each of the four walls bears a large set of double doors.You recognize the Mining Level as the lowest level of Dorôwil. There is an expansive network of mines and tunnels below this level, but you are currently on the deepest level of Dorôwil city proper. The rail cart system should be somewhere on this level."
664,Graehamkracker,"""The rail cart system should be somewhere on this level"""
665,BeefyChickens,"""Lets try and find it quickly as possible then!"""
666,Nightwing32193,"""And this will get us out from under these mountains?"""
667,Graehamkracker,"""Ought to."" Bendron moves to open the door on his left."
668,Dragodar,"The party finds themselves in a hallway. Chadwick stands directly behind Bendron, his torch illuminating the area."
669,Graehamkracker,Bendron strolls down the hallway towards where he things the mines would be
670,Dragodar,"Turning right down the hallway and making his way through the passage on the left, Bendron leads the party through a small tunnel into an expansive chamber. This cavern is vast in the horizontal dimension, spanning almost fifty feet across from where they stand to the opposite wall and over a hundred feet across from left to right. But the ceiling is low compared to the other large chambers they've seen, barely more than ten feet high. The ancient ruins of advanced mining equipment litter this room. Everything from hammers and picks to giant mechanical drills and hydraulic excavators lie scattered about this chamber, completely broken down, rusted, and falling apart, but still bearing mute witness to the assiduous work ethic of the extinct Yundri clan. It is apparent to the party that they have found a small portion of the deep subterranean quarry from which the Yundri mined their precious ore."
671,Dragodar,"The party turns away from the quarry to seek the railcars, and heads back into the neatly carved halls. Leading the way, Bendron heads south down a long hallway. After almost a hundred and fifty feet, the corridor opens up to a mid-sized room, about 30 by 50 feet. Several large pulleys, outfitted with heavy winches and clasps that have long since rusted and fallen off their rotted away ropes.Though you have never seen Dorôwil in person before, you recognize a loading platform when you see one.

676,Dragodar,"Seamus pauses, a slight frown of concentration furrowing his brow. His lighthearted boyish attitude seems to diminish as the perpetual, carefree smile fades from his face.""Someone's coming... Lots of them..."" He looks up at the faces of his older party members with terror in his eyes, his gaze searching their faces for some form of reassurance or instruction.Bendron approaches the double doors and attempts to open them. With a heavy push, the door swings away from him... about two inches. Like the rest of the doors they've encountered, the hinges seem unobstructed by rust or wear. But something heavy on the other side is preventing them from opening.Demryon: (1d20+9)25Seamus: (1d20+10)19Gideon: (1d20+2)16Bendron: (1d20-1)13Chadwick: (1d20-1)10You feel the slightest tremor in the earth beneath your feet, and on the edge of your consciousness, so faint that you wonder if you're imagining it, you hear a deep and steady thumping, almost like an imperceptible heartbeat.Drums. Drums in the deep. Your sensitive ears begin to pick up on the sound of war drums from very far away, though you cannot discern the direction. The faint clank of metal indicates several dozen armed entities quickly approaching your location. They are still far away and most of the rest of the party cannot hear them."
677,BeefyChickens,"""We are DEFINITELY not alone, we need to move as quickly as possible, a large force will be upon us soon. Lets move!""Demryon rushes forward and begins to help Bendron shove the door open."
678,RealZachKraus,"""Drums.. drums in the deep. They are coming."""
679,Graehamkracker,"""Quit your nonsense and help me with this door!"
680,RealZachKraus,"Chadwick closes his eyes. ""Mellon,"" he says. He opens one eye inquisitively."
681,Graehamkracker,"Exasperated, Bendron throws his weight against the door, hoping to budge what holds it closed or fracture the door's wood with his halberd."
682,Dragodar,"The door barely budges half an inch as Bendron and Demryon throw their entire weight against it. It seems to be moveable, but too heavy for the elf and dwarf to move on their own. Their efforts are in vain as they repeatedly slam their shoulders into the door while the rest of the party watches. The sound of drums reaches their ears from afar. Somewhere deep in the caverns below Dorôwil, life stirs. The ancient dwarven halls are not, ostensibly, as abandoned as they originally appeared. The clash of metal on metal rings out faintly as armored hosts mobilize.Bendron and Demryon grunt and sweat as they continues to pound ineffectually on the large doors. With a start, Seamus breaks from his reverie and rushes to Bendron's side. He begins throwing his small weight into the door along with the pair, a look of determination on his face. Despite the extra help, the door remains unmoved as Chadwick and Gideon stand and watch the trio struggle."
683,Nightwing32193,"""Chad, stop being an äss."" Gideon calls out as he moves to help with the door."
684,Dragodar,"Chadwick quickly joins in to help, and the entire party pushes against the door with all their might. With the five of them pushing on it, the door begins to inch open a little bit at a time. Expending their effort in waves, by counts of three, they are able to budge it open inch by inch. A loud grinding can be heard as whatever is behind the door slowly scrapes across the floor under the pressure of their pushing.The drums seem to be growing noticeably louder, and along with the clash of armor, the party is now able to hear the shrieks and shouts of some unknown foe, obviously hungry for blood. Agonizingly slowly, the door inches open. Soon, the opening is wide enough for Bendron to slip through. From the other side of the door, Bendron can see that a large, blocky stone cart is upside down, its heavy metal wheels in the air. Pulling with all his might, Bendron is able to tilt the cart toward him and tip it over onto its side, away from the door, which immediately swings open. As the door opens and Chadwick's torch shines through the doorway, the party is able to see two very old and dry but very recognizable dwarf skeletons behind the cart. They seem to have died trying to barricade the door. The room they are in is small, about 10 by 20 feet, with another set of double doors opposite them. Rushing to these doors, the group finds that they open much more easily.At this point, the party finds themselves in a long hallway. Just on the other side of the second set of doors lie three more skeletons, still grasping their pikes and glaives, lying cold and still on the ground. To their left, the party sees a single door about five feet across. It is made of metal and is barricaded with several heavy bulwark rods and two large bar locks. As the party observes this door, the shrieks grow distressingly loud behind them; their pursuers are catching up. To the right, the hallway extends into darkness.Suddenly there is a loud clattering and banging on the metal door to their left, as though swords and hammers are pounding on the other side. This is immediately followed by a deafening crash that causes the heavy metal doorframe to shake and vibrate, as though something very strong is slamming the other side of the door with something very heavy."
685,RealZachKraus,Chadwick pushes too.
686,Graehamkracker,"""No need to see what that is."" Bendron states as he begins to jog down the hallway into the dark"
687,Nightwing32193,"Gideon draws his great sword, ""I say let them come, take revenge for your kin, Bendron!"""
688,RealZachKraus,"Chadwick grimaces, ""This is no mine. This is a tomb."""
689,Graehamkracker,"""The best <i>revenge is for the Yundri to prosper once more, and return this land to it's former heights."""
690,Nightwing32193,"Gideon grits his teeth, visibly upset about running from a fight, but ultimately realizing Bendron is right,""As you say, Ben."" he shoulders his sword and follows the dwarf down the hall."
691,RealZachKraus,"Chadwick swings the door shut behind them and heaves the cart back in front of it, hoping the force chasing them will be as dissuaded as they were. He pauses to stretch, then takes off after Ben."
692,Dragodar," LinkSpotify LinkBefore taking off down the hall, Chadwick and Gideon slam the first set of doors and heave against the heavy stone cart, pushing it back against the door to block it. Then they quickly following Bendron and the others, as the banging on the metal door behind them grows faster and more insistent.Just over fifty feet down the hall, the passage opens up into a wide dais in the middle of a huge open chamber. On each side of the dais, there is a loading platform attached to a series of rails which extend in every direction, disappearing into black tunnels. There are four rails, two of them running north-south and two of them running east-west. The southern edge of the dais seems to be broken and crumbling, but every loading platform seems to be sturdy and whole.With a sinking feeling, the party sees over a dozen dwarf skeletons scattered across the dais, all still clutching their polearms. In addition, there are four railcars dispersed around the dais, but none on the tracks. They are identical to the one used to barricade the door, and likely just as heavy. To use one, the party will have to roll it to the platform and load it onto the tracks. Each cart looks big enough to hold two people, though Seamus and Bendron may be small enough to fit a third person in their cart if they go together.The crashing and banging from down the hall continues loudly, and the shrieking and clamoring grows louder as the foes seem to grow more numerous and agitated. The muffled shouts echo down the stone halls as the party takes stock of their situation. They are coming."
693,RealZachKraus,"Chadwick yells ""These are the rails you were talking about, eh Ben? Pitter patter lets get at her."" He runs to one of the carts, grabbing one end. He stares at the rest of the party expectantly."
694,Nightwing32193,"""Demryon, use your bow, make sure none of those creatures come through that tunnel without an arrow in their chest. Ben, help Sheamus start getting these rail cars ready to go. Chad and I can hold off anything that gets through if need be."""
695,Graehamkracker,"""Yes. They should be a smooth exit, if we can tell which one is the best way out. Does anyone have anything that can roll down the track?We could use your strength to move these - the boy may be better suited to defending the door."""
696,Nightwing32193,"Gideon nods, ""Chads got this anyway.'and procedes to help the dwarf."
697,Dragodar,"Seamus moves to join Demryon at the entrance of the hallway, but first turns to the dwarf. ""Bendron! Catch!"" The boy tosses a small pouch to Bendron, who reaches out and snatches it deftly. Looking inside, the dwarf sees that it contains a dozen or so marbles.Seamus then takes his place next to Demryon, preparing for the onslaught.Each set of parallel rails slope in opposite directions, providing a gravity-driven energy source for long distance transportation. On long trips without frequent stops, the railcars are capable of reaching very high speeds, despite the gradual nature of the slope, due to the near frictionless wheels the dwarves were able to manufacture.Each railcar is equipped with a lever that functions as a gradual brake capable of slowing or stopping the cart when pulled to varying degrees. Bendron knows that this brake would have had a thick cap of vulcanized rubber on the bottom end under the cart, but the rubber has long since dried, cracked, and fallen off, so the ends of brakeshafts are nothing more than stone. Stone grating on stone could have dangerous consequences if one were to attempt to use the worn brake at high speeds. Something similar to rubber wrapped around the brakeshaft may be able to function as a temporary brakepad."
698,Graehamkracker,"Bendron catches a bag of marbles from Seamus, then rolls one along each rail to discern the slopes.""We're going to need something to fix the breaks. Something like <i>kumista- solid, compressible, and lots of friction - on the end of this lever here. Or magic. Magic could work. Any ideas? Bendron calls out as he goes through his own possessions."
699,Nightwing32193,"""Yell if you need us. Good luck. And do i look like a civil engineer to you? Seamus, come over here see if you can do anything with this."""
700,Dragodar," LinkSpotify LinkBendron tests the eastern north-south rail with a marble as Gideon and Chad strain to turn one of the carts up onto its wheels. Ever so slowly, the marble begins to roll to his left, heading north. By process of elimination, Bendron concludes that the western rail slopes south. There is a splintering sound from down the hallway and suddenly the shouts and battlecries are much less muffled. The wooden doors seem to have been breached, though the heavy cart blocking them has obviously slowed the enemy's progress, as they haven't come rushing into view yet. There is a loud grating sound though, and it is apparent that they are in the process of pushing the cart out of the way much like the party did minutes ago.Seamus turns around and calls back to Gideon, ""What is it? I'm about to be a little preoccupied!""Having concluded the direction of the rails, Bendron rushes over to help Chadwick and Gideon with the cart, telling them to push it onto the western rail. Another deafening slam reverberates from the barred metal door. Lou whimpers as the piercing echo bounces off the stone walls."
701,Graehamkracker,"""Magic, boy! Could you slow the carts down once we start moving?"" Bendron bellows as the group sets to work on the second cart"
702,Dragodar,"Seamus wracks his bran for a moment, a panicked look on his face. ""I might have been able to if I hadn't summoned that hippogriff! My arcane energy is so low now, I don't know what I could do!"" The boy stares back at Bendron, a helpless look on his face."
703,Nightwing32193,"Hearing the noise Gideon draws his sword, ""You ready to put that bow to use? Friend?"" he winks rogueishly at his Elven companion."
704,BeefyChickens,"Demryon smirks at Gideon, then looks down at his bow as he tests the draw. ""I've been waiting to show her some real action,"" he says with a smile."
705,Dragodar,"Gideon takes his place next to Demryon, Seamus, and Lou as Bendron and Chadwick finish heaving the cart onto the track. The cart immediately begins to roll south until Bendron quickly pulls the lever. The harsh grinding sound of stone on stone comes from under the cart as its movement instantly stops. It sits still on the tracks. One down, one to go.Seamus looks up at Gideon, the look of panic still glued to the boy's face. ""What do you want me to do? I don't know what to do!"" The child's voice rises significantly in pitch as the fear becomes evident in his voice. The pressure seems to be getting to the boy."
706,Nightwing32193,"Gideon gets on a knee next to Seamus and puts a hand on his shoulder. Staring into the boys eyes, ""Calm down, Seamus. We won't let anything hurt you. But you need to stay calm. Think. Just stay calm and think. Ben, you know dwarven architecture best, any ideas?"""
707,Graehamkracker,"""We'll have to use what we have, and hope that there are some old fail-safes in place for our lack of breaks."" Bendron grunts and he and Chadwick inch the second cart to the tracks."
708,Dragodar,"Bendron and Chadwick begin to overturn the other cart, trying to get it up on its wheels. Once on their smooth, well crafted wheels, the railcars are fairly easy to move, but getting them upright is the difficult part. The paladin and the dwarf stand side by side, straining to lift the cart.Suddenly, a billowing cloud of black smoke erupts from the doorway that was blocked by the cart, and simultaneously a thunderous blast of shattering stone resounds throughout the chamber, deafening the entire party momentarily. Everyone feels the shock in their chest as the very air around them seems to become a solid wall of force for an moment, and its concussion knocks everyone in the party off their feet. Bendron and Chadwick drop the cart as they lose their balance.Bendron: (1d20+3)8Chadwick: (1d20+6)17Chadwick manages roll away from the cart, but Bendron is not so lucky. As the blast knocks him off his feet, his leg is caught under the heavy stone railcar and it slams down on his knee, causing him to scream out in agony.You are now at 11/43 HP.In an instant, everything is quiet. The adventurers hear only a loud ringing in their ears; everything else is muted. The dark smoke quickly seeps throughout the hallway, completely blocking the party's view of the end of the corridor and the metal door.As their hearing slowly returns to them, the adventurers hear the terrifying sound of shrieking rushing down the hallway toward them, but the smoke completely obscures their vision.(1d20+9)17Seamus: (1d20+3)13Gideon: (1d20+3)14Bendron: (1d20+2)12Chadwick: (1d20+2)5Otyugh 1: (1d20+4)12Otyugh 2: (1d20+4)12Goblin 1: (1d20+3)15Goblin 2: (1d20+3)11Goblin 3: (1d20+3)13Goblin 4: (1d20+3)16Fomorii 1: (1d20+1)10Fomorii 2: (1d20+1)17Fomorii 3: (1d20+1)9Fomorii 4: (1d20+1)17Fomorii 5: (1d20+1)4Fomorii 6: (1d20+1)14Fomorii 7: (1d20+1)8Fomorii 8: (1d20+1)19Fomorii 9: (1d20+1)21Fomorii 10: (1d20+1)8Fomorii 11: (1d20+1)14Fomorii 12: (1d20+1)8"
709,Nightwing32193,"Gideon lets out a maniacal laugh, ""FINALLY! Let them come!"" he draws his great sword and postures towards the hallway. Probably will go into RAGE waiting to assess the situation"
710,Dragodar," LinkSpotify LinkAs the smoke begins to clear, the first thign the party sees are the all too familiar tentacles of the beast they fought earlier. This time though, it seems to be joined by two of its kind. Following these beasts and barreling toward the party at full speed, are a dozen or so hideously deformed humanoid monstrosities, entirely unlike anything that anyone in the party has ever seen before. Truly the stuff of nightmares, they resemble humans only inasmuch as they are bipedal and have the same general body shape, but they are completely disfigured and mutated, horrible to look upon. In true fomorrii fashion, none of them shares any resemblance to another. Each one is its own species of foulness, their form so unthinkable and unnatural that they do not even share any degree of uniformity. Mixed in amongst these abominations are two huge spiderlike beings. To the party's horror, however, a cursory observation reveals that they are not spiders at all, but corpses sewn onto giant spider legs, belly up, animated by some dark magic. These anathema horrors scurry toward the party in their skin-crawlingly spiderlike manner, moving simultaneously naturally and horrendously unnaturally as they rush forward.From the back of this queue of scum, you see several grey skinned goblins, their evil faces twisted with expressions of hatred and malice, clutching evil looking bows with arrows already nocked.Remember this guy? He's brought two of his friends this time:...And they brought some goblins with them:...And the goblins brought some ugly-ass MFers along for the ride:...Who brought with them these... things:Deformed Humanoid 10</li></ol>"

717,Dragodar,"Gideon's face gets red as he lets out a deep shout of fury, flexing every muscle in his body and howling at his enemies with feral rage. The first to reach him is a pair of the hideous fomorii.

Despite his poor blow, he cleaves easily into the body of the creature, cutting it in half. To his disgust, its individual halves continue to writhe helplessly on the ground, reaching for him ineffectually. Before his mind can process this new horror, the next wave is upon him. Two more deformed fomorii beset him, followed closely by the hideous corpse spider. The spider's corpse-head gazes ahead with dead eyes as its mutated mandibles click and drip with ichor. The fomorii continue their aimless slashing and flailing, as the corpse spider rears back and strikes at Gideon with lightning speed.Fomorii 5 Attack: (1d20)19Fomorii 5 Damage: (1d8)1Fomorii 5 Attack: (1d20)10Fomorii 5 Damage: (1d8)6Corpse Spider 1 Attack: (1d20+4)13Corpse Spider 1 Damage: (2d4+2)9One of the fomorii misses entirely, while the other barely clips Gideon on the arm, nicking him with its razor sharp claws.

The searing pain seems to flow with his bloodstream as he feels it move through his body.Seamus waves his arms frantically and shouts a word that nobody understands. Suddenly massive roots and vines spring forth from between the stone tiles of the floor, grasping several of the enemies around the engaged trio. The living roots squeeze and entangle the enemies, restricting their movement and preventing them from advancing.""RUUUUN!"" Seamus screams, his voice cracking in terror. A third arrow flies from the smokey hallway toward Demryon.Goblin 3 Attack (Chadwick): (1d20+2)9Goblin 3  Damage (Chadwick): (1d8)6The arrow flies past the ranger as he dodges to the side.

726,Graehamkracker,"Bendron moves to attack the monster between him and Chadwick, footwork sloppy as he struggles to keep weight off his injured leg. He raises his halberd high and brings it down at the monster's head.Mountain hammerHave +1 ATK against goblins and orcs, not sure if applies hereAttack: (1d20+9)22Damage: (2d6)10Using that halberd to steady himself, he switches to a two handed grip, takes a couple short steps backwards, and prepares for the monsters rebuttal.Wall of blades if attack against me would hit"
727,Dragodar,"Despite his broken leg, Bendron manages to make contact. His halberd shaves through the foul being's shoulder, severing its arm. It hardly seems to notice, and its arm continues to swat and grasp uselessly on the ground.The remaining enemies are currently stuck and incapable of acting due to Seamus' entanglement spell. : Entangle (2/2) rounds: Unconscious (1/2) rounds<u><i>Round 2Fomorii 10</li></ol>Keep in mind that there is still smoke obscuring the hallway behind the goblins.

728,BeefyChickens,"Demryon grabs the unconscious barbarian under the armpits. ""Chad, now!"" he shouts, beginning to drag Gideon toward the railcar."

730,RealZachKraus,"Chadwick snaps back into action,""Careful with him, he's fragile!"" his only regret being that the barbarian was not awake to hear his sweet burn. He grabs him by the legs and with Demryons help, they move his unconscious form over to the tracks and heave him into the empty cart."
731,Dragodar,"The elf and the paladin drag Gideon toward the cart as the fomorii moan and gnash their teeth, unable to pursue. The enemies who are not entangled are stuck behind those who are, and are frustratedly trying to make their way around.Within seconds, Demryon and Chadwick are heaving the limp barbarian into the cart.: Entangle (1/2) rounds: Unconscious (1/2) rounds<u><i>Round 3Fomorii 10</li></ol>Keep in mind that there is still smoke obscuring the hallway behind the goblins.

732,BeefyChickens,"Demryon shoves the cart forward, rolling it onto the tracks with Chad's help. The elf then leaps into the cart as it barrels down the tracks."
733,Dragodar,"Demryon and Chad successfully push Gideon into the cart, and subsequently the cart onto the track.""Here they come!"" Seamus cries.The vines begin to wither and die and the enemy creatures begin to pull themselves free. Bendron wobbles uncertainly on one leg, still almost 25 feet from the cart, as the deformed beings once again rush forward.: Entangle (2/2) rounds: Unconscious (1/2) rounds<u><i>Round 3Fomorii 10</li></ol>Keep in mind that there is still smoke obscuring the hallway behind the goblins. There may be more foes there, but you can't see."
734,Graehamkracker,"Bendron slowly hobbles towards the cart, digging in his bag as he goes. He pulls out a rope, wraps it tightly around his left forearm, and tosses the knotted end towards Demryon and Chadwick. ""CATCH AND PULL!"""
735,Dragodar,"With a last ditch effort, Bendron heaves the rope into the air toward Chadwick as their final hope. The enemies are just beginning to break free and rush forward as the rope sails toward Chadwick's hand. As though in slow motion, the slender rope sails through the air. Everything in the room seems to slow down as Chadwick's eyes track the rope through its flight. In his peripheral vision, Chad sees the enemies break completely free from their bonds and lunge at Bendron. For a moment, everything seems to stand completely still. Chadwick feels the beads of sweat on his neck and smells the stench of the deformed monsters racing toward them. Entirely focused on the rope, he doesn't notice the desperate expression in the dwarf's eyes, clinging dearly to this one last hope for salvation.

The paladin reaches forward with a grunt of effort as he strains for the catch. The rope slaps his palm, and his fingers wrap deftly around it.In an instant, Chadwick wraps the rope twice around his forearm and grasps it tightly. Simultaneously, Seamus kicks the brake lever on his cart and begins to roll away with Lou.Demryon reaches out his hand to Chadwick, who takes the elf's arm with his free hand. Demryon yanks the lever with his left hand while straining with all his might to pull Chad into the railcar with his right. With a roar of exertion, the elf heaves Chadwick into the cart as it begins to roll forward.The cart seems to move agonizingly slowly at first, but only for a moment. Within two seconds, it is picking up speed, following Seamus into the black of the tunnel. The rope tightens, and Bendron skids across the floor onto the tracks. The enemies lunge at him, gnashing their teeth and shrieking in anger, but he slips past their fingers and disappears into the tunnel, bumping painfully across the metal tracks.Dragging Behind the Railcar Damage: (3d6)11You are now at 9/43 HP."
736,Graehamkracker,"Between grunts and bumps along the ground, Bendron calls out in broken gasps ""Pull....e...up....balance...carts"""
737,RealZachKraus,"""Elf! Gonna need you to hop skip and jump your ass over to that other cart, pal. Not gonna be able to just hold this guy forever."""
738,BeefyChickens,"""Seamus! Im going to need you to use that handbrake, get as close as possible!"""
739,Dragodar,"Seamus looks back as Demryon shouts to him. The boy looks uncertain, hesitating for a moment before yanking on the lever in his cart. With a harsh screech, like nails on a chalkboard, the cart skids along the tracks, sending sparks flying up in its wake. With a crunching sound, the bottom of the brakeshaft crumbles, leaving chunks of stone along the track as it sends bright sparks into the air. Seamus' cart slows rapidly, the second cart quickly gaining on it and rear ending it. Within moments both carts come to a complete stop. The front cart's brakehaft is wedged into the tracks but it is splintered beyond use.Bendron groans as his painful journey comes to an end. Everyone is exhausted, but they can hear the shrieks and roars of the enemy behind them as they pursue the party. They must act quickly, or within a few minutes the enemy will be upon them once again.Gideon stirs, still unconscious but slowly coming to.You are now at 38/38 HP.You are now at 9/45 HP, and you will regain consciousness in 1 round.You are now at 18/32 HP.You are now at 9/43 HP.You are now at 31/31 HP."
740,Graehamkracker,"Bendron struggles back to his feet and walks up to the back cart. He passes the end of rope he was holding to Demryon: ""Here, take the rope and tie it down in that first cart. We're making a train."" He starts to find a good place to secure the rope to the rear cart."
741,BeefyChickens,"""I really hope this works Ben... Demryon says with an obvious look of concern on his face, as he moves to assist the dwarf."
742,Graehamkracker,"""Me too. But I'm out of other ideas. More ropes should help though.Boy! Do you think we could get that cart moving again?"""
743,BeefyChickens,"""Luckily, I have some. Alright lets get this train goin."""
744,RealZachKraus,"""I got some rope too, threes company boys. Ben once we get moving again, lemme take a look at that leg."""
745,Graehamkracker,"""Please and thank you."" Bendron replies as he climbs into the back cart and helps to tie the two closely together"
746,Nightwing32193,"Gideon begins to stir, muttering something in broken Ul Vadr followed by, ""Ellia..."""
747,Dragodar,"Bendron works quickly, lashing the ropes through the rings on the carts. Within seconds, he has several knots tied. The shrieks are very close behind them now; any moment the enemies will come barreling out of the darkness into the light of Chad's torch.The brakeshaft of Seamus' railcar is jammed in the tracks, but so much of it has crumbled off that it is barely keeping the cart stationary. A solid push would complete the crumbling and break the remaining chunks of loose stone from the the shaft, sending the cart down the rails.The howls and yells of their pursuers are extremely close."
748,RealZachKraus,"Chadwick approaches the first cart and gets ready to push. ""Alright dwarf I hope your knots hold, we got company. If Seamus can heal your leg I'd get up with him."" He gives the cart a shove to get it moving again, then hops back in the cart with the wounded."
749,Graehamkracker,"""Too late now - theres no way I'm jumping moving carts with a bum leg. Let's just enjoy the trip and see of we can't bring your friend back to us."""
750,Nightwing32193,Gideon coughs up blood onto himself and Bendron's beard. Still mumbling in Ul Vadr
751,RealZachKraus,"Now that the carts are moving away from the imminent danger, Chadwick turns his attention to his fallen companion. Visibly shaken, fighting back tears, he lays his hands upon his head. ""Alright let's see what strength I still have in me."" He begins to murmur under his breath, asking Hyroneus for assistance. Gonna use the full 15(?), if I can. "
752,Dragodar,"With a crunch, the brakeshaft of the front cart crumbles, and the two carts once again begin to roll down the tracks, quickly picking up speed but still leaving a trail of sparks from the broken brake.As the carts begin to move, Demryon nimbly leaps up and hops across to the front cart, settling himself in behind Seamus and gripping the sides of the cart as it gains speed. The railcars begin to roll down the tracks, and as they do, the party members are barely able to see the pursuing enemy, just over sixty feet behind them, barely within the light of Chad's torch. Within seconds, however, they disappear into the darkness once again.The railcars are picking up speed at an increasingly rapid pace, and the roar of the solid metal wheels on the smooth stone track combines with the howl of the air rushing past them to drown out all other sound. Chad lays his hands on Gideon's head, muttering his prayers. He feels a warmth in his fingertips as he uses the last of his power for the day, but knows that it was only a minor help, as he had already used up some of his allotted healing earlier in the day to heal Gideon's broken arm.As Chadwick murmurs his prayers, Gideon's eyes flutter open, squinting in the torch light as the wind of the tunnel causes the flame to stretch behind the cart.You are now at 14/45 HP."
753,RealZachKraus,"""You with me bud?"""
754,Nightwing32193,"Gideon blinks, but stays silent for a few seconds as he takes in his surroundings. Remembering what happened he raises both eyebrows and widens his eyes as if waking from a nap, ""What in the name of Kord is happening?"""
755,RealZachKraus,"""Oh yeah, and we have no brakes."""
756,Dragodar,"Seamus yells back from the front of the first cart, ""I think we're in a got dang tunnel!"" His voice is mostly drowned out by the wind and the wheels, but they are able to make out his words."
757,Nightwing32193,"Gideon smiles,""Sounds like another Tuesday, huh Chad?"""
758,RealZachKraus,"Chadwick shakes his head with a grin. ""Sorry I can't do anything about your leg, I'm only one man. Where we headed, anyway?"""
759,Graehamkracker,"""I don't know why I trusted you with that tapestry."""
760,Nightwing32193,"Gideon raises the middle finger of his right hand towards the dwarf in an obscene gesture, ""Because your lazy ass didn't feel like carrying it I'd assume."""
761,Graehamkracker,"Ignoring the alien gesture and combative tone, Bendron replies ""I would gladly take that bag from you - I don't want everyone's belongings be lost with you next time you make a reckless grasp at a shadow of glory."""
762,Nightwing32193,"Gideon unshoulders the haversack and rumages through until he finds the dwarf's tapestry. He gingerly pulls out the parchment, then tosses it in Bemdron's direction,""Carry it yourself then."""
763,RealZachKraus,"Chadwick pushes his hands in between them. ""Alright this is a stupid fvcking thing to get bent up about. Bendron, do you have any idea how long we have on this track?"" "
764,Graehamkracker,"Bendron reshuffles his pack, removing the sword and dagger and gingerly placing the tapestry inside. ""No. But we'll know where to stop when we get there."""
765,Nightwing32193,"Gideon drops the tapestry on Bendeon's lap then quickly withdraws his hand and puts it in his lap, looking innocently at the ceiling of the tunnel."
766,Dragodar,"The carts continue to roll on down the rails, and soon the monotonous drone of the wheels on the track and the air in their ears becomes almost relaxing. After several minutes, Chad's torch goes out, and the party races on in complete darkness. Soon however, their eyes adjust and they realize that they are able to see the tracks in front of them. After a few moments of confusion they see that the ceiling of the tunnel is covered in the same purple crystals that adorned the ceiling of the training cave.Minute by minute, the railcars rush smoothly along the tracks as the low hum of sound and the dim glow of light lull them into a calm state, causing their adrenaline to fade and their pulses to return to normal. Looking out at the tunnel walls, the cart passengers are able to see vestiges of dwarven architecture. Every two minutes or so, maybe more, the railcars pass through a hewn archway carved with dwarven designs and runes.It has been about 15-20 minutes since the party narrowly escaped the monstrosities in Dorôwil. They have been traveling smoothly since then.With your darkvision, you are able to make out runes atop each passing archway. The archway you are currently passing under reads, ""Gornulir: 14 Delðai."" Turning around, you can see that the other side of the archway, which is quickly receding into the distance behind you, reads, ""Dorôwil. 9 Delðai.""The one before that read, ""Gornulir: 15 Delðai."" And before that, ""Gornulir: 16 Delðai.""The delði is the standard Yundri measurement unit for long distances. 1 delði is approximately half a league, or approximately 1.5 miles, or approximately 2600 dwarf paces, or approximately 8000 feet. Judging by the timing between archways, you are traveling at somewhere between 25-30 delðai per hour, or 35-45 mph. At your current pace, you should reach the station at Gornulir in about 25-30 minutes.Gornulir, when it existed, was directly on the west coast of Aezelon, about halfway between where Tuefa and Farindahl currently stand on the map. By your memory, the tracks heading east from Gornulir's railcar station end at Strönd Quarry, which used to be located just under 15 miles west of where Farindahl currently stands. You are now at 38/38 HP.You are now at 14/45 HP, and you will regain consciousness in 1 round.You are now at 18/32 HP.You are now at 9/43 HP.You are now at 31/31 HP."
767,Graehamkracker,"Bendron speaks up as the train passes under the next arch. ""Ah. Now I know where we are. We're just over 20 minutes from <i>Gornulir on the coast. From there we could follow more rails to a quarry within reach of Farindahl."""
768,Nightwing32193,"""Hey, mate, I'm sorry, didn't realize that tapestry meant so much to ya. I'll carry it still if you'll let me. I acted out of spite just now and I apologize."""
769,Graehamkracker,"""It fits here for now. We'll find a more permanent solution once we've all had some respite"""
770,Nightwing32193,"""Aye, how much longer would you say 'til we're out?"" "
771,Graehamkracker,"""Twenty some minutes to the next stop, then another hour or so to the quarry."""
772,Nightwing32193,"Gideon lays back and closes his eyes, ""Chad, you doin' good brother?"""
773,RealZachKraus,"""I'm swell as that bruise on Bendron's leg. Try and rest up boys. I'll wake ya up when we get there."""
774,Nightwing32193,"""I was hoping you'd say that."" with that, Gideon winks at Chad, closes his eyes and attempts to sleep."
775,Dragodar,"The railcars continue down the tracks as the party rests to the best of their ability. After about fifteen minutes, their speed begins to slowly decrease. It is hardly noticeable at first, but soon they begin to lose speed at an increasing rate. The thunder of the wheels on the track becomes a dull roar as the carts grow slower and slower. The slope of the tracks seems to have evened out, effectively causing the railcars to coast smoothly to a creeping pace.As they approach the station, they see a large stone sign next to the tracks. Though faded with age, the deeply carved runes on its surface are still intelligible for those who speak their language. A stone marker, much like the hand of a clock, rests to the right of center. Past the sign, the passengers are able to make out a wide loading platform much like the one they recently escaped, but larger.Ahead, the tracks split into two directions. There are many other tracks here, heading in multiple directions.Gornulir was a central hub for the rail system, being situated in prime location between Strönd Quarry and several major Yundri cities. As such, there are many track switches and intersections at this station. The track switches were all controlled from a single control room near the loading platform, though Bendron only knew this in theory, not from experience, as he had never been to Gornulir."
776,Nightwing32193,"Feeling the cart slowing, Gideon pops his head up and looks around.Liam's aware its probably safe, but listen check for pursuing enemies. Just in case.""Well, what now? Can you read that sign Ben?"" he asks, pointing at the sign."
777,Graehamkracker,"""Yeah - this is our stop, and we need to head to the left."" Bendron says, pulling the brake to try to stop the train at the platform."
778,Nightwing32193,"""Any idea how much longer til we are out from under this mountain?"" asks Gideon as he gathers his gear and climbs out of the railcar."
779,Graehamkracker,"""Could you two get two carts onto that other rail? Hopefully two with brakes. The three of us can undo these ropes."""
780,Nightwing32193,"""If those didn't have any way to stop what makes u think any of the other ones will?""  asks Gideon as he makes is way towards a new railcar."
781,Graehamkracker,"""Nothing, but those carts are all closer to the other rail than these two we've been using are."""
782,Nightwing32193,"""Really beginning to think I'd be better off as a monk."" he adds, walking slowly and deliberately, obviously still in great pain from his wounds."
783,Dragodar,"Bendron pulls on the lever of the back cart, causing the brakeshaft to wedge into the tracks and send sparks flying. Soon, the cart comes to a complete stop, its brakeshaft completely worn down. The party sits within a slowly settling cloud of dust, thrown up by the broken brakeshaft. They are directly next to the loading platform."
784,Graehamkracker,Bendron starts untying the ropes that hold the two carts together.
785,Dragodar,"After a few minutes of fiddling with the ropes, Bendron manages to untie the carts from one another. They remain relatively still, having reached a perfectly level point in the track.Gideon hops out of the back railcar and Seamus follows suit. Lou follows Seamus, and rushes past him to begin sniffing around the platform. Seamus stands on his tip toes and raises his arms high above his head, stretching. ""Oof, those carts were kind of cramped,"" he mutters as bends his head side to side, stretching his neck."
786,Nightwing32193,"""We need to keep moving. Lets get these carts on the tracks."""
787,Graehamkracker,"Bendron limps amid the carts, hoping to find some with semi-functional brakes"
788,Dragodar,"Bendron moves from cart to cart, and soon finds one with a cap on the brakeshaft. The cap is rock hard and cracked all throughout, but still there. Two other carts are in the same condition, caps present but severely eroded and petrified."
789,BeefyChickens,"""Well I suppose were here for awhile, so lets have a look around. Bendron be on the lookout for anything interesting."""
790,Nightwing32193,"""He just found two fûcking carts, now will you puh-lease help us move them onto the rails so we can get the fůck out of here? Chad. And Demryon?"""
791,Dragodar,"""I can't create something from nothing, but if they're broken at all I can do minor repairs,"" Seamus offers, trying to be helpful."
792,BeefyChickens,"""Not a problem Gideon, but while we are here, I think it may be wise to assess where we are exactly, Ben? he says as he walks towards the nearest cart"
793,Nightwing32193,"""Who you callin an ass? Elf?"
794,Graehamkracker,"Before answering Demryons question, Bendron points Seamus to the brakes of the carts closest to the tracks. ""ASSESS. It means looking at something to answer a question."""
795,BeefyChickens,"""A fair point Ben; we better waste no time then."""
796,Dragodar,"The party wastes no time in hauling the heavy carts from the platform to the east west rail. After several minutes of strenuous effort, they have two of the huge railcars positioned on the tracks. ""Everything is all set then? I have a minor spell for making repairs but if these carts are already good to go, I vote we get out of here,"" Seamus says, casting an eye toward the ancient skeletons across the platform."
797,Graehamkracker,"""Those brakes may be in need of mending."" Bendron answers as he climbs into the front cart"
798,Dragodar,"""Try to describe to me exactly what it should look like. The better I can picture my finished product, the better a job I'll be able to do."""
799,Graehamkracker,"""Should be a smooth, black end cap. Shiny. Shiny enough for you to look for a reflection, but too dark for anything to be clear. A shape to fit against the rail - smooth with an angled groove to ensure a snug fit...."" Bendron continues as such for a while."
800,Dragodar,"Seamus nods. ""I think I've got it,"" he says, half certain. He crouches down over the brake and feels the material with his fingers. He mutters a few words under his breath, and some of the cracks in the material close up. Seamus knocks lightly on the cap to test its hardness and an audible rapping can be heard. Not quite satisfied, he whispers a few more words and rubs the cap with his hands. It's petrified appearance takes on a glossier sheen. He knocks on it again and the sound is muted and inaudible this time. He rubs it between his fingers and it appears almost sticky, with lots of friction on its surface. After a few more moments and another whispered word from the boy, the rest of the cracks close up and the brakeshaft cap takes on a smooth, lustrous gleam. Seamus rubs it firmly between his fingers again to make sure, then holds his hand up to Bendron, displaying a few dark black flecks and smudges of the material on his fingertips.""I hope so, because I'm all out for today,"" he mutters softly, an exhausted look on his young face. He sits down next to the cart and glumly rests his face in his hands.The soft cap feels very similar to dwarven <i>kumista but not identical. Not quite ideal, but certainly viable. It is slightly softer and duller than true <i>kumista, with a squishier substance but a rougher surface texture to it than the original. It isn't perfect, but it will work."
801,Graehamkracker,"""Looks perfect. Let's all hop in and get going"""
802,RealZachKraus,"Chadwick is dumbfounded by Seamus once again seeming to pull magic out of thin air. ""Is no one going to touch that...? Ok let's get the hėll outta here but we are gonna have to know a little more about you, kid."" He shakes off his heebie-jeebies and climbs into a cart."
803,Nightwing32193,"""Well he's shot balls of fire and summoned a winged horse...are you really surprised at this point? But yes. Lets get going."""
804,Graehamkracker,"Bendron reties the ropes, keeping the carts close together, and once everyone is ready sets the carts moving"
805,Dragodar,"Soon, the railcars are rattling down the tracks at a steady clip, and the group settles in for the ride. Within minutes, Seamus is fast asleep. The crystalline ceiling is far dimmer along this stretch of the tunnel; though it is not entirely dark, it is very difficult to even make out the other passengers in the cars. The carts continue down the rails for about thirty minutes to the dull roar of the wheels.Demryon: (1d20+9)16Gideon:(1d20+2)11Seamus:(1d20+10)14Bendron:(1d20-1)13Chadwick:(1d20-1)7As the cars race down the rails, there is a sudden flutter of motion from above and large dark shape falls toward the carts. What appears to be a large mantle or cloak drops down from the ceiling, timed to meet the carts on the track. Before anyone can react, the large black blanket-like thing converges with their trajectory and flops down over the back cart.(1d20+7)22The dark shape lands with a quiver on the paladin at the back of the cart train. As soon as it makes contact, it shakes and shivers, flapping around and hissing. It attempts to grab onto Chadwick and wrap itself around him, but he manages to fight it back, staving off its attempt to envelope him. With an angry hiss, it raises its flat body up, catching the draft from the motion of the cars and flying up into the air. As it falls behind the carts, it whips out a long, barbed tail and catches the back of the cart. It pulls itself forward with its tail and latches onto the car, using a pair of nasty looking pedipalps with sharp looking claws on them. Between the pedipalps, those nearest the back of the cart can make out an incredibly ugly face, bearing a huge mouth lined with sharp fangs.From wingtip to wingtip, the creature is almost ten feet across.Knowledge (Dungeoneering and Spelunking) Check: <i>+3 Skill Modifier+2 Collector of Stories(1d20+5)18 (basic knowledge reward)You recognize the creature as a <i>cloaker. It is an intelligent creature from the deepest depths of the world. They were rarely seen in dwarven civilization, being creatures of the deep and typically residing far beneath the depths to which any dwarf would descend. When resting or lying in wait, these creatures are almost impossible to distinguish from common black cloaks (the cloakers ivory claws look very much like bone clasps). Only when it unfurls does the horrific nature of the creature become apparent. Cloakers usually lie still, watching and listening for prey, then try to engulf and constrict their victims. You know that a cloaker has a huge larynx relative to its body size, which is capable of producing extremely low frequencies. These subsonic moans cause most other creatures to feel a deep sense of dread. When affected by this mind-altering sound, the cloaker's victim may become scared enough to be distracted and perform poorly in combat, or may be so overcome with fear that they flee involuntarily, or may become so nauseous that they are unable to even fight back, or may even be so affected by the frequency that they become catatonic and unable to act at all.Available Bonuses to Choose From:+1 competence bonus to AC, attack rolls, damage rolls, or the save DCs of your spells against this particular opponent+2 competence bonus to one saving throw against a particular effect (a certain wizard's spells, poison, or to avoid traps, for example)+2 competence bonus to one skill check to accomplish a particular taskDemryon: (1d20+9)24Gideon:(1d20+3)18Seamus:(1d20+3)11Lou:(1d20+3)19Bendron:(1d20+2)15Chadwick:(1d20+2)20Ugly Blanket Monster:(1d20+7)21Seamus</li></ol>"

809,Nightwing32193,"Gideon makes eye contact with Chad and rolls his eyes.  After knowing Gideon as long as you have, there's definitely a semblance of fear and regret in the Barbarian's eyes. "
810,Dragodar,"Demryon reacts instantly, releasing two arrows in such rapid succession that they almost seem to leave the bow at the same time. As he does, the creature releases its hold on the cart and the wind catches it yet again, causing it to fly up into the air, attached to the cart only by its tail. In the confined space of the cart, Demryon's draw is restricted and his shots suffer from it.<i>+9 RAB+1 misc-2 Cramped ConditionsAttack 1: (1d20+8)18Attack 2:(1d20+8)23<i>+1 miscDamage 1: (1d8+1)3Damage 2: (1d8+1)7The first arrow whistles past the creature.

Demryon's second arrow strikes it dead center though, causing the creature to hiss angrily.It's abdominal area seems to expand for a moment, like a balloon, before suddenly contracting. Everyone in the railcars is aware of a deep and powerful hum, barely too deep to hear with their ears but loud enough that they can feel the vibration in their chests. The sound is inaudible but tangible, and the powerful thrum rattles the skulls of the passengers and vibrates their internal organs.At the first sound of this throbbing hum, Seamus starts awake with an immediate look of terror and confusion in his eyes.Everyone feels a sudden and intense fear as their entire bodies shake to the frequency of this terrible moan. Their heads are suddenly overcome with splitting aches and sharp pains, their guts contract throb with pain, and their very skin seems to sting as it vibrates across their flesh.DC 16(1d20+2)18 You feel sheer terror course through your body, but you are able to keep your wits about you.(1d20+2)11 You feel sheer terror course through your body, and you pass out cold.

Gideon involuntarily falls into the fetal position, clutching his head, desperate to protect himself from the awful intonation. Lou whines and whimpers, cowering into the corner of the cart, desperate to distance herself from the sound.

Bendron hops out of the track onto the roughly hewn ground of the tunnel ready to make his way around to the back of the cart. As the railcars stop, Lou looks up and ceases her whimpering.

The tail is immediately severed, and begins to twitch and flail on its own like the tail of a lizard. A hideous squeal, sounding almost more like a whistle, escapes the monster, and it suddenly releases its hold on the paladin.Chadwick falls back into the cart, completely limp as he becomes visible to the party for the first time since being enveloped.

First, the monster itself falls backwards out of the cart and onto the track at Bendron's feet. It huge form thrashes about in agony as its massive wings flap and flutter uselessly. Second, a small blonde head pops up from the front railcar.

831,Dragodar,"Survival Check: (1d20+5)19As you run your gaze over Chadwick's wounds, you realize that he is in very bad shape. He is stable for now, but severely injured.As the rest of the party inspects Chad's gruesome body, they see that three arrowheads are broken off in his back, and there is a nasty set of fang marks on his calf, presumably accidental side effects of Lou and Demryon trying to help. But that is not the worst of it. Chadwick's chest and face are fiercely savaged. Long, brutal gashes mar his face and neck, and blood seeps from the gaps in his breastplate near the neck and arms. His entire face is red with blood and covered in nasty cuts, and his arms and shoulders are soaked in blood as well. He is breathing, but weakly.Now that the fighting is over, the group takes a look at each other and realizes that they are in bad shape as a whole. Bendron's leg is broken and he bleeds from several painful looking wounds. Gideon, much like Chadwick, is covered in a slew of nasty looking gashes, is soaked in blood, and is looking particularly weak and pale. Seamus has a large bruise on the side of his head that is oozing blood slowly, and a dark stain on the left side of his ribcage. Lou's fur is matted and sticky with blood, and she seems to be limping slightly. Demryon seems almost completely fine, having managed to keep his distance from the worst of the melee; he bears several ugly scratches but nothing serious.The still air of the tunnel feels stifling and hot to the adventurers, who are already warm from the combat they've been slugging through."

844,Dragodar,"As the party discusses a course of action, the paladin stirs slightly. A brief cough escapes his lips, and his eyes slowly open. Gradually regaining consciousness, Chadwick looks around and takes stock of his surroundings."
845,Nightwing32193,"Startled by the sudden show of life, Gideon jerks his head up, then immediately groans in pain and clutches his neck, ""Thank your gods, Chad. I almost started praying for you."

859,Dragodar,"Chadwick grasps the small talisman, shaped like a silver shield, which hangs around his neck, as he struggles up from his prone position and onto his knees. Closing his eyes and muttering a prayer to his god, the paladin lifts the shield amulet and and the rest of the group feels the same tingling in the air as before. For several minutes, Chadwick remains in prayer, his eyes shut and his lips moving almost imperceptibly.Chadwick: (8d6)29Gideon: (8d6)20Seamus: (8d6)24Lou: (8d6)28Bendron: (8d6)37Demryon: (8d6)41A static crackle builds in the atmosphere around them, humming and shivering as Chadwick prays.

Everyone feels revitalized and refreshed, and everyone's wounds are miraculously closed and already covered in scar tissue.Only Gideon and Chadwick remain even slightly injured, and even they are almost completely healed.

861,BeefyChickens,"""Were just as anxious as the other to be out of here. The oversight is quite understandable, lad."""
862,Nightwing32193,"""You're one tough son of a bïtch Ben. But we needed to recoup. Now lets get moving again."""
863,RealZachKraus,"With his unarmored hand, Chadwick reassuringly pats the dwarf on the shoulder. ""Well the important thing is I'm alive. Let's get the hėll outta here."" He lifts his axe and strides back towards the carts."
864,Dragodar,"The party regroups and once again enters the railcars. Pushing the brake handle forward, they set off down the tracks. After about ten minutes, the cart slows down, rattling and bumping along, the ride no longer smooth. Within seconds, the carts have stopped. Investigating the cause, the group of adventurers discovers that the tracks are covered in dirt. Until now, the tunnel had been entirely rock. The tracks disappear entirely after a few more yards, seeming to continue straight into the dirt, as though the earth had grown up around them. A few yards further down, there seems to be an interspersing of mushrooms in the soft soil.The unfortunate revelation of the end of the rails, however, is not their only discovery. Looking further down the tunnel, they are able to see a tiny pinprick of light in the distance. It seems to be over half a mile off, though accurate depth perception in the small, dark tunnel is difficult to come by."
865,Graehamkracker,"""Looks like a bit of a hike, and then we're out. I wonder what the mines will be like with this tunnel caved in."" Bendron climbs out of the cart as he speaks, and starts the walk toward the tunnel's mouth"
866,Dragodar,"The party disembarks from the railcars and trudges forward through the soft dirt. As they near the mouth of the tunnel, they realize that the ceiling is closer than it had been. Back before the soil, the ceiling was nearly twelve feet above the tracks. About halfway to the mouth of the tunnel, it was closer to eight. By the time the party was within twenty yards of the mouth, all but Bendron and Seamus were stooping low to avoid hitting their heads on the rock ceiling. Reaching the exit, they find the opening to be just over four feet high, and barely ten feet across though it had been over twenty. The natural movement of the soil had clogged the entrance of the tunnel over the years; they were lucky that it hadn't completely closed it up.Squeezing through the opening, the party tumbles out into blinding sunlight. For several moments, their eyes slowly adjust. When they are no longer dazzled by the bright light, they are able to see that they are in a huge quarry. The deep crater they are in is roughly rectangular, and the huge expanse is nearly 600 by 1500 feet. The sheer walls of the massive pit ascend in step-like segments, the circumference of the crater growing wider and wider in sharp, regular intervals nearer the surface. Each segment of the walls is over one hundred feet high, and there are four segments. Connecting each level to the next are long, gradual ramps, hewn directly from the earth.Like this:In front of them lies a massive quarry lake, the result of many years of natural rainfall over the deep quarry. Across the lake lie the ancient and overgrown remains of long untouched mining equipment, harshly weathered by the elements. From the position of the sun, it seems to be early to mid morning.You are <i>Dazzled by the sunlight.By your best estimate, it is about 9 am on Wednesday, Iru 10th."
867,Nightwing32193,"Gideon drops to his knees and raises his arms above his head,""Sunlight. I never thought I'd be happier to see it."" standing back up he surveys the quarry in front of his party. Trying to determine wether or not it was able to be climbed."
868,Dragodar,"Connecting each level to the next are long, gradual ramps, hewn directly from the earth."
869,Graehamkracker,"Looking around to take in his surroundings, Bendron starts ""So of this is , as it seems to be, we ought to be to the west of any peoples. There used to be a collection of <i>markaðir to the east some tenortwenty miles from here - those may have grown to form this <i>Farindahl"

871,Graehamkracker,"""May as well get moving then."" Bendron replies as he heads up the slope."
872,RealZachKraus,"Chadwick pauses before heading up the ramp, ""Hey Elf, your people DO have liquor, eh?"""
873,BeefyChickens,"""We do not distill any liquors in Faridahl, but we do however have wines that will put a dwarf on his back end."""
874,RealZachKraus,"Chadwick shrugs then smiles, ""Yeah that'll play. Let's move."" He nudges Gideon.""Good for somethin, eh?""He takes off up the ramp at an alarmingly quick rate."
875,BeefyChickens,"""Youll like it Chadwick, you have my word. I dont want to get yours hopes up, but my father and I had quite the collection of decanters, that we liked to store our imported whiskey in.

876,Graehamkracker,"""How many of these orcs may we expect to find?"""
877,BeefyChickens,"""No more than four thousand. I know the odds seem a little stacked, but Ive sent my owl to Moedri for aid in reclaiming Farindahl. Our combined efforts should more than even the odds."
878,Graehamkracker,"""Is there a plan, or are we just going to march over there and request their formal surrender?"" Bendron replies with a jovial jab"
879,BeefyChickens,"""I do not know what the future holds, but one look at your mug and Im certain we will see white flags."" Demryon says with a chuckle"
880,Graehamkracker,"""If they hold any memory of the Yundri, thats all it would take. Do you know if they came from the mountains, or from across the sea?"""
881,Nightwing32193,"Gideon sprawls out on his back. Still clearly enjoying the sunlight. Keeping his eyes closed he addresses the elf, ""What can you tell us about these orcs? I'm assuming by sheer number of them they aren't native to Aezalon."""
882,BeefyChickens,"*""They came from the sea, Bendro; and Gideon, just like any Orc, big, ugly and like taking things that do not belong to them."
883,Graehamkracker,"""Wonderful. I've heard tell of the <i>Afanafi, but no more than thirdhand. Now I can see how accurate those stories were."" Bendron replies, with a new pep in his step"
884,RealZachKraus,"Chadwick let's out a low whistle, ""They're horrible, disgusting creatures. About the size of a man, but that's about the end of the comparison. They garble some indecipherable tongue, they worship the devil, and they smear themselves in their own feces. They engage in homosexual acts as part of their sick rebellion against nature, are corrupted. They carry no banners, they profess no creed save kill and destroy, they build no dynasties, and they always leave the fücken door open. You have no idea the depths of depravity the Muor are capable of."""
885,Graehamkracker,"""Boy, I have been fighting orcs and their ilk in all their depravity for some 45 years since my <i>Selecting, and we have been fighting them for ages before for the very survival of the First Cities. I have a pretty good idea, but I don't doubt that these are also cruel in their own ways."" Bendron's tone softens as he goes, remembering that those days are long past for all others."
886,Nightwing32193,"""Aye, and that about sums it up. Chad and me spent a year fighting them when they invaded Audaria a few years back. Great time if im being honest."""
887,Dragodar,"As the party converses, they make their way up the long ramps and out of the quarry. The temperature at the lip of the quarry feels more than ten degrees warmer than at the bottom. To the west and north, the Sudrin Mountains stand strong and tall in all their majestic glory. To the east, long flat grasslands extend as far the eye can see. To the south, a narrow river winds its way out of the quarry and across the grassy plains, extending for several miles and then, far in the distance, emptying into the vast blue of the sea.Already, despite the early morning hours, the sun shines down on the group, noticeably warming them. Looking east, they are able to see a few lonely trees peppered sporadically across the landscape, but they are few and far between, and the road east is a long one with minimal cover or shade.The heat of the environment contrasts sharply with the wintery cold north of the mountains. It hardly feels like winter at all here.The quarry is about where the river exits the mountains. This picture is not from your current vantage point, or even the current time of day; it's just to give you an idea of the landscape.It is about 9 am on Wednesday, Iru 10th. The temperature is currently about 70* F. (It was about 40* F north of the mountains.)"
888,Graehamkracker,"Looking at the sparse road ahead, Bendron asks ""I thought you elves preferred forests over drylands."""
889,BeefyChickens,"""If you were speaking of the Moedri or the Valhiri, you would be correct. However, my people, the Audari, prefer the warmth of the southern summers and the openness of the plains."""
890,Nightwing32193,"""Do your people use mounts?"" "
891,Dragodar,"The party buckles down and prepares for more walking. They head off into the morning sun, tramping doggedly across the wide, grassy plain ahead of them. The first couple hours go by comfortably, but as the sun rises higher in the sky the adventurers begin to notice a distinctly annoying lack of shade. Every couple miles or so, there will be a small tree or two, but they find themselves spending most of their time in direct sunlight. By noon, their skin is already pink and warm to the touch where exposed. Bendron is already noticeably sunburned and the rest are soon to follow.The grassy plain still stretches to the horizon in every direction. With Demryon's compass, they are able to keep a steady tack east southeast. As usual, their progress is somewhat slowed by Seamus. The boy marches along quietly and without complaint, but his short legs can only carry him so fast.It is just after noon on Wednesday, Iru 10th. The temperature is currently about 80* F."
892,Graehamkracker,"Grimacing under the sun, Bendron grumbles ""This is much worse than the caves were."""
893,RealZachKraus,"Chadwick shoots Bendron a sympathetic look. ""I'm sorry you're wasted on this cross country. I don't know much about you dwarves, but I've heard tell you're natural sprinters."""
894,Graehamkracker,"""Mayhaps. Though I'd imagine that most sprinters do not wear all this armor."""
895,RealZachKraus,"Chadwick laughs heartily, ""You sell yourself 'short,' bud! I'll bet you're very dangerous over short distances."""
896,Dragodar,"As Chadwick and Bendron chat cheerfully, a few indiscernible shapes become visible near the horizon. They are still too small to make out, but they don't quite look like trees.The five little brown smudges in the center/left of the image, in the depression on the side of the hill."
897,Graehamkracker,"""What would I sell myself for?"""
898,RealZachKraus,"Chadwick can barely keep a straight face at this point, ""Hey dere, Demryon, what do your elf eyes see?"""
899,Nightwing32193,"Gideon blocks the sun with one hand amd squints, attempting to make out the shapes."
900,Dragodar,"Demryon squints, shielding his eyes with his hands as he surveys the horizon. ""Whatever they are, they aren't moving. We should proceed with caution, regardless. I can scout ahead if the rest of you want to backtrack a bit and wait under that tree we just passed.""The elf turns and points at a small tree about thirty yards behind them, and looks from one companion to another, waiting to hear their opinions."
901,Graehamkracker,"""Shade sounds great"" Bendron speaks as he heads back and sits down in whatever shade he can find"
902,RealZachKraus,"""Twist my arm bud."""
903,Dragodar,"Demryon nods with a wry smile as the group eagerly retreats to the tree. He swings his pack off of his shoulder and kneels beside it, rummaging around inside for a moment. He pulls out a yellowish brown cloak, replacing it with his dark green one. Swinging his pack back over his shoulder, he stands, holding the new cloak out in front of him. He looks at the cloak, then up at the landscape in the direction of the mysterious shapes in the distance, then back at the cloak. With a nod of satisfaction, he pulls it over his shoulders and clasps it, drawing the hood over his head and past his brow.Adjusting his pack to a comfortable position, Demryon takes a step forward, and begins walking with a strange gait. He seems to bend and flow in the wind, moving with the grass in perfect harmony with the landscape. With bob here and a dip there, his strange lilting gait causes his appearance to almost shimmer and waver. Even as they watch, his companions begin to notice the edges of his frame becoming blurry as he grows further away. Within seconds, they have lost sight of him completely. His ability to blend with the landscape is so astonishingly well trained that even under their careful observance, he has disappeared entirely from view.The party members shake their heads in wonder and turn to await the elf's return in the shade of the tree. Once they've seated themselves comfortably, they scan the landscape, searching for their elf friend. Every few minutes, one of them will spot him for just a moment and point him out to the rest, only to watch him disappear again right before their very eyes. Impressed, they realize that only the most vigilant enemy with the sharpest eyesight could ever spot him approaching.The shade of the tree is a cool relief from the constant sun, and the party rests and rehydrates while they wait for their friend.=============Despite the absurd effectiveness of Demryon's ability to blend in, it <i>does slow him down significantly, and his progress is very gradual. The party waits for ten minutes, twenty, thirty... As the sun crawls lethargically through the sky, the party feels a pleasant drowsiness coming on. But despite their comfortable position on the soft grass under the shady tree, the duration of Demryon's absence slowly begins to instill worry in their minds. After almost forty minutes, they begin to wish Demryon had told them how long to expect him to be gone.It is almost 1:00 PM on Wednesday, Iru 10th. The temperature is currently about 85* F."
904,Graehamkracker,"""Are those other shapes still out there?"""
905,Dragodar,Yes. Still just as vague as before though.
906,Nightwing32193,"""Yeah, they're still out there. Cant quite make out what it is though. Looks like possible battle or marching formations."""
907,Graehamkracker,"Bendron sighs. ""Guess we need to go save our elf then."""
908,Nightwing32193,"""What should we do? Get closer and assess the situation?"""
909,Graehamkracker,"""May as well. Worst case they see us, and we have to kill them"" Bendron gets up and stretches, running through a few attacking motions against the empty air."
910,Nightwing32193,"""And possibly, maybe, find our elf."""
911,Dragodar,"The group gathers their things and heads out, following Demryon toward the unidentifiable shapes. As they walk, they realize that the shapes are further than they thought. After about fifteen minutes, they only seem to have gotten halfway there. At this point they are able to see that the shapes resemble large tents or temporary structures. After walking for another ten minutes, the adventurers are still about 500 yards from the tents, and as of yet do not see any movement or activity around them.=============As they continue their approach, they soon spot a figure heading their way. Within minutes, they realize that it is none other than their friend Demryon. He advances at a relaxed pace, showing no sign of sneaking or fleeing. As they get closer, he waves at them."
912,Graehamkracker,"Bendron shrugs a response. ""We got antsy. Find anything fun?"""
913,Dragodar,"""Sorry, friends. I should have mentioned that my methods can take a while. I actually only reached the tents about twenty minutes ago. I was just on my way back to fetch you."" Demryon smiles, looking around at his companions. He gestures for them to follow him as he turns and heads back toward the camp.""And shade."""
914,Graehamkracker,"""The only thing worse than bad news is not knowing what that news is. Out with it, so we can rest without guessing."""
915,Dragodar,"The elf smiles at Bendron's simple wisdom. ""I only say to wait because it is a rather complex matter that should be explained in full when we arrive. But if you want the short version: the orcs of Muorichos are pressing their advantage."" Demryon's smile fades and a somber look falls over his features. ""The invasion only gains momentum with every passing day, and the kingdoms of Aezelon are unprepared for it. Three months ago, the orcs sacked my city, Farindahl. If they capture the cities of Suldetta and Armodahl on the edge of the Sudrin Mountains, they will have a nigh unbreakable hold on the Audarian peninsula, and Aezelon may not be able to drive them out.The elf pauses and an expression of sorrow flits across his face. ""We will go over the details later,"" he says, growing quiet.=============Soon, they come upon the ambiguous structures. Not quite houses but more than tents, they seems to be fashioned from wood and hide. The branches and trunks of young trees make up the bodies of the structures, and large, thick animal skins are stretched across these frameworks. As they enter the camp, they see about ten elves standing around, curiously looking on, several of them no more than children. Demryon approaches an older looking male elf and shares a few words with him. Then the two of them approach the rest of the companions. The elf is even taller than Demryon, nearing seven feet in height. Inasmuch as elves are able to look grizzled, this one does. His blonde hair shows traces of gray and is tied in a haphazard topknot on his head, and a hint of scruff covers his chin. He has a thin scar down the side of his face, and his dark gray eyes are piercing and hard.""This is Uamm. He was an Elder on the Council before Farindahl was sacked.""The elf greets them and adds on to Demryon's introduction. ""I was also a very close friend of the duke before he died, and my loyalty to his family shall not soon fade. If you are friends of Lord Demryon, I consider you friends of mine."""
916,Graehamkracker,"""Our friend here says that things are growing more dire by the day. How are your folk holding up?"" Bendron directs his question at Uamm"
917,Dragodar,"Uamm looks down at the dwarf standing behind Gideon's massive frame, seeing him for the first time. A look of shock flits across his face for a moment. ""We are doing quite well, good sir. I must say I am surprised to see one of the <i>Đwérgir here in Audaria,"" he responds, respectfully using the dwarvish word for their own race. He lowers himself to one knee in front of Bendron. Glancing over the dwarf's armor, Uamm's eyes widen in disbelief. ""My friend, if I am not mistaken... you are not of the Thandi. Your armor bears the markings of the Yundri... but that cannot be. They have been..."" he pauses for a moment, at a loss for words. He looks Bendron in the eye with a searching gaze. ""Yundri maeb ert þú örugi yn ddim?"" he asks in a whisper, using Bendron's native tongue.""Surely you are not a son of Yundrica?"""
918,Graehamkracker,"""ég er ekkert annað""I am nothing else.""We had returned to the first cities, and worked to hold up the mountains against the storm. They buried us, but we persisted long enough to find some ways to survive. A fortnight ago we were holding back the mountain and it's more feral inhabitants, and now it is some 1500 years later and things are quite different."""
919,Dragodar,"""My grandfather used to tell me stories of the Yundri,"" Uamm says, remaining on one knee. His face bears the signs of disbelief and wonder. He struggles for words as he tries to express his confusion. ""Even among the elves it is almost three generations since Bovurum Leiðogúfall led the last Yundri from the fallen cities. They went north many years ago to join Thandos. I must admit there is much I do not understand..."" Uamm continues to inspect Bendron, his face asking all the questions his mouth could not articulate.He pauses, remembering his manners. ""Friends, you will eat and rest tonight. We do not have much to offer, but what we do have is yours."" The elf looks back at Bendron, addressing the dwarf directly. ""I have many questions for you, master dwarf. I would ask that you sit at my side while we sup.""<i>Leiðogúfall translates to ""One who led out from the mountain"" in Yundri. It is not a title that Bovurum had when you knew him.Uamm stands and turns to Demryon and addresses him in elvish. ""Meh tärea kustella valloi. Katso huonä toivo, herre.""""We have important matters to discuss about the invasion. Things are looking very bad, my lord."""
920,Graehamkracker,"""Of course, as long as you can field some of mine. I'm very interested in these stories about Bovurum, son of Bovuram and how his <i>Leiðogúfall came about."""
921,Nightwing32193,"Gideon looks down at the dwarf, ""Huh. Looks like you got yourself an admirer, mate. Lucky for us I suppose. Wasn't aware your people held that kind of respect in these parts. I'd love to hear your tales as well when the time comes."""
922,Graehamkracker,"""We used to be all over the continent: if not as artisans or builders, then as vanguard or bodyguard. And our own cities and armies were a sight to behold. Time is a devastating force when no one works against it."""
923,Nightwing32193,"Gideon nods,""Thats truth, Ben."" he says with a sigh. Turning around he walks back through the entrance of the camp. He then proceeds to unbuckle his weapons and armor and place them together in a neat pile before beginning a lap around the camp and a brisk pace."
924,RealZachKraus,"Chadwick is getting impatient, ""alright I'm SURE we're all wet for the dwarf but it can wait. Can we talk about the pressing threat please?"""
925,Nightwing32193,Gideon is out of earshot. Now doing 100 pushups next to his gear. Enjoying being out from under the mountain.
926,Graehamkracker,"""You two just don't rest, do you?"""
927,Nightwing32193,Gideon is now shadow boxing.
928,Dragodar,"Uamm addresses the group. ""Come. Rest and eat, for you must be weary. We will discuss these worrisome matters with food in our bellies.""He beckons for them to follow him and heads toward one of the larger tents. As he passes by the other elves, he introduces them. Pointing to the couple and their children, he says ""This is Ulan and his wife Aeim. Their children, Efa, Ruah, and Arlian. Uran worked as a courier in Farindahl; their family lived near the center of the city."" Uran and Aeim are both yellow haired and rosy skinned, and their children bear the resemblance. Uamm gestures to the younger elves as he says their names. Efa is a young girl who appears to be about 12-14. Ruah is the next child, a boy who looks to be 8 or 9. And Arlian is the youngest; he looks to be only 5 or 6 years old but already his elvish features give a sharp and angular quality to his boyish face.The only other elves in the camp are four older looking teenagers -- two boys and two girls -- who seem to be sticking closely to one another's company. Uamm introduces them as well. ""These gentlemen are Alwin and Daien, and these ladies are Ennas and Muira. They were outside the city when it was sacked. They were separated from their families in the evacuation.""As they enter the tent, Uamm turns to Aeim. ""Aeim, would be willing to do us the kindness of preparing some food for our guests?""""Of course, it shall be but a moment,"" she responds with a smile. She turns and rushes away toward another tent. As she fetches the food, Uamm leads the group into the cool shade of the large tent, leaving Gideon outside to his exercise. The ceiling of the structure is comfortably high, over eight feet off the ground, and the inside is roomy and comfortable. It's over ten feet across and almost twenty feet from the door to the back. The floor is made of tightly woven strands of long prairie grass, and is soft underfoot. Scattered around the room are silky cushions and thin fabrics. At the center is a table, only a foot or two off the ground. Light trickles in from several small openings in the roof, which are just large enough to let light in and promote airflow but not large enough to let the intense sunlight heat the room."
929,Nightwing32193,"Finishing his warm up, Gideon unsheathes his massive great sword and rests it carefully, but skillfully on his shoulder. He walks a few more paces away from the camp and makes sure the area around him was free of anyone, and begins to move his sword in vast, sweeping arcs. The strokes are not of combat, more fluid and restrained. Gideon breathes deeply as he continues his exercises. Keeping the blade always in motion as he did his best to stay calm and reserved. After about ten minutes, he places the greatsword back in its sheath and draws his short sword and dagger. He repeats the same exercise, this time dual-dual-weilding. After ten minutes of that he lays all his weapons out in front of him on the grass. Sitting cross legged he inspects them closely and attempts any needed maintenance on them."
930,Graehamkracker,"Bendron picks a coushion and sits. ""How long have these orcs been here?"""
931,Dragodar,"Uamm takes a seat next to Bendron, crossing his legs and leaning back comfortably on one of the cushions. ""It's been about three months since Farindahl fell. Most of the evacuees made it to nearby cities within a fortnight, but there were many stragglers. Ulan and Aeim, and their children, were on their way back from Suldetta when Farindahl was sacked; I intercepted them before they got too close to the city, but we had to abandon their wagon to escape an approaching scout party. We headed north and found the youths a week or so later. They weren't in the city during the battle because they had been out in the foothills, camping. We found them while they were on their way back to Farindahl."" Uamm reaches behind his cushion and withdraws a stack of small wooden cups and a twine-wrapped bottle as Demryon and Seamus take their seats around the table.""We haven't been able to make much progress because of a number of factors. The small children are unable to travel very far, and we've had several sicknesses and injuries. At this point, we're taking it slow and easy. We're still a little close to Farindahl for my liking but we've managed to avoid any orc parties. My personal priority right now is finding any other stragglers and helping them get to refuge."" Unstacking the cups, Uamm sets them on the table and uncorks the bottle. As he pours, a dark red liquid spills into the cups.He passes the cups out, pushing them across the table toward the party. ""This is Greybriar wine. Be careful, it is stronger than most."" Uamm raises his glass and brings it to his lips."
932,BeefyChickens,"Demryon smiles and gives Chad a nod. ""This is the stuff I was telling you about."" He raises his glass with a smile and downs his drink."
933,Graehamkracker,"Benson takes a cup and thanks his hosts before another question: ""What of the armies? I'd imagine that the orcs are preparing another offensive out of Farindahl before too long?"""
934,RealZachKraus,"Chadwick takes the cup gratefully. ""What are your numbers looking like, battle-wise? I've had some experience with these bastards."""
935,Dragodar,"The wine is dry, and very strong. It has an exotic and spicy taste to it, and its aroma lingers in the nostrils after the swallow. The sweetness offsets the burn, but an alcoholic warmth tingles in their bellies that reminds them more of spirit than wine.A serious looks comes over Uamm's face, and he pours himself another glass. ""You'd imagine correctly, master dwarf. Already the scouting parties have been spotted near Suldetta and Armodahl, and Aezelon's coalition has yet to send reinforcements. Some kind of political nonsense is going on up north and we're losing precious time.""The elf pushes the bottle to the middle of the table, opening the offer to everyone seated. He turns to Chadwick. ""As of right now, we have no numbers. Once I get this group to Tuefa, I will travel to Armodahl and try to get their military mobilized. Suldetta and Armodahl are already beginning their evacuations, but are hesitant to send their armies to Farindahl for fear of being overrun. Altogether, Suldetta has a standing army of less than a thousand, and Armodahl has barely fifteen hundred. There are almost five thousand orc warriors in Farindahl alone.""Uamm pauses and sips his wine. ""As you can see, things looks bleak. Our only silver lining is that we sent word to the Moedri requesting that they dispatch a force of three thousand elves about a fortnight ago. If they acquiesce, that army should arrive at Farindahl before month's end. But if Suldetta and Armodahl don't mobilize soon, the Moedri will not be able to recapture Farindahl on their own."""
936,BeefyChickens,"Demryon's ears perk up at the mention of the Moedri. """"What of the captives? Do you know how fare the elves I was with? Henri and Efren, and the rest? I pray to all the gods they have not been tortured or executed, but knowing orcs I do not cling tightly to that hope.""Demryon searches Uamm's eyes for some kind of answer, a look of concern and worry on his face."
937,Dragodar,"Uamm shakes his head. ""No word. We have not been able to get a spy inside the city. But after a month in orc captivity, I would not hope too highly either. It doesn't help that we know so little about the Muors' motivations, either. Aezelon is still scrambling to figure out why they invaded in the first place, and the first wave of attack was almost two years ago. Their methods are still a mystery to us, so we don't know if they have reason to keep prisoners or not.""As Uamm takes another sip of wine, the hide door is pulled side and afternoon sun streams into the room. Gideon's massive frame stands in the doorway, his face flushed and his body drenched with sweat. He is breathing heavily as he looks around the room."
938,Nightwing32193,"""Whats in the jug?""  he asks, interested at the possible sight of alcohol."
939,BeefyChickens,"""You'll like it."""
940,Dragodar,"""Orcs,"" Seamus pipes up, answering Gideon's other question as he sips his cup of Greybriar."
941,Nightwing32193,"""Now, what about this about orc filth?"""
942,Dragodar,"Uamm and Gideon's companions offer him a quick summary of what's been discussed, bringing him up to speed."
943,Graehamkracker,"""how are we to fit into all this?"""
944,Nightwing32193,"""If we're here to kill orcs, let's fûcking kill orcs. What are we waiting for?"""
945,Graehamkracker,"Bendron settles in with the drink, seeming comfortable planning and explaining his ideas to the group. ""There are only a handful of us and a few thousand orcs. They have the advantage, and we cannot act as a hammer, smashing wherever we please. But if we act as a needle, carefully picking what vulnerabilities to pierce, we can weaken our for until we are ready to play the hammer."""
946,Nightwing32193,"""Horses would make this easier for us. I'm a good rider and would be able to scout the country around us for raiding parties and the like. It would give us a better idea of what we're up against."""
947,BeefyChickens,"Demryon smiles at his friends' eagerness to help. ""Thank you, my friends. My main objective right now is a rescue mission. My friends are in Farindahl's dungeon, or dead. I would be no leader if I did not try to ave them. We'll need recon first, which will be difficult since even if one of us was able to infiltrate the city, we would stick out like a sore thumb amongst the orcs. Once we've determined my men are still alive. We'll organize a rescue from there. It will be dangerous, my friends. But I humbly ask your help."""
948,Nightwing32193,"""Far be it from me to turn down a chance to kill Mours again. You have my sword."""
949,Graehamkracker,"""Sounds like there may be more sneaking than slaying, but that does seem to be a good start."""
950,Dragodar,"Demryon finishes his drink, nodding at Bendron's words. ""My plattoon is probably being held in the garrison prison. We'll need to sneak in and ascertain their location before we mount an actual rescue. And we'll need several of us to make it work.""Demryon grabs his bag and rummages around in it for a moment before withdrawing a tattered piece of folded parchment. Unfolding it, he spreads it across the table, revealing it to be a map. In the low light, his companions are able to see that it is an annotated map of the city of Farindahl. Though there is no written legend to accompany the small numbers on the map, Demryon quickly explains it to them from memory, defining each numbered section in detail."
951,Dragodar,"Demryon finishes his drink, nodding at Bendron's words. ""My plattoon is probably being held in one of the garrison prisons. We'll need to sneak in and ascertain their location before we mount an actual rescue. And we'll need several of us to make it work.""Demryon grabs his bag and rummages around in it for a moment before withdrawing a tattered piece of folded parchment. Unfolding it, he spreads it across the table, revealing it to be a map. In the low light, his companions are able to see that it is an annotated map of the city of Farindahl. Though there is no written legend to accompany the small numbers on the map, Demryon quickly explains it to them from memory, defining each numbered section in detail.""As you can see, there are two garrisons, so we'll have twice the recon to do. Unless anyone has an ideas, Uamm and I will spend tonight brainstorming how we're going to pull this off. Anyone who wants to sit in and help is welcome, but you're also more than welcome to get some well deserved sleep if you prefer."""
952,Nightwing32193,"""Do the orcs still let caravans inside? That seems like it'd be a decent enough cover for us.""  "
953,Graehamkracker,"""Where does the city get it's water? That could be a way in too.""I wanted to roll something, it's been a while(1d20+3)20"
954,Nightwing32193,"""Also the shanty town doesnt look too bad a place to make a base, once we get in that is. What have the orcs done with the citizens?"""
955,Dragodar,"Uamm shakes his head regretfully at Gideon's question. ""They only allow Muorish caravans. Food and supplies enter from the south or the southeast gate. Typically, their supply trains are heavily guarded. We would have to intercept a supply caravan and take out the guards, and even then we wouldn't be able to get within half a mile of the city without being detected... unless you have some extremely convincing orc disguises hidden in your bag and can speak orcish.""Demryon answers Bendron's question: ""There is a natural spring in the center of the city which has been aqueducted to the garrisons to form moats. The water from the spring is cold, clean, and potable, and there are several communal wells around the edge of the city that provide additional sources of water.""Uamm nods at Demryon's words. Turning back to Gideon he answers the barbarian's second question. ""The civilians evacuated before the siege. The majority of the soldiers left in the city were killed during the battle. The shantytown is in disrepair so you're right in thinking that the orcs would likely choose other locales for their dwelling. There are several buildings in the shantytown that are always on the verge of collapse, so facilitating that collapse may provide a diversion if we end up needing one."""
956,Nightwing32193,"""Well thats one out of three for brilliant ideas thus far. What about causing a diversion so huge that the orc forces would be forced to mobilize and leave the city? Some sort of bluff, or great show of force we don't have."" "
957,Graehamkracker,"""What would make them want to give up the walls rather than hunker down?"""
958,Dragodar,"Aeim enters the tent holding a large bowl in either hand. Behind her, Efa and Ruah follow suit. The three of them set the six bowls down on the low table. ""Thank you, Aeim. It looks delicious as always,"" Uamm says with a smile. Efa and Ruah scamper out of the tent, and Aeim smiles at Uamm's thanks. She nods and follows her children wordlessly. Each bowl contains what appears to be an entire deboned chicken, steaming hot and slathered in a vibrant red spice. Mixed with the meat is mixture of sauteed vegetables. The spicy, savory scent tantalizes their nostrils as the steam wafts gently from the bowls. They have had nothing but trail rations since they left Aldus.""The Moedri's three thousand are due to arrive in a month, but three thousand is not nearly enough to make the orcs abandon the city and retreat, and a month is a long time to wait even if it were,"" says Uamm as he reaches into his bowl and scoops a handful of food into his mouth, chewing thoughtfully."
959,Nightwing32193,"""A month's time is too long. By then the orcs will be dug in and we may never get them out of your city. If we make a move now, they may not expect it because of the state they left your people in."""
960,Graehamkracker,"Bendron gratefully takes a bowl and starts to eat. ""Sounds like we need to move soon then. This infiltration business is all new to me - I've only been on the other end. Maybe something like a feint or a loud, small diversion could at least demand enough attention that we could slip in elsewhere?"""
961,Dragodar,"Demryon looks up from his meal. ""If we can sneak weapons in with us, the elves in my plattoon are extremely capable fighters. They were Farindahl's special forces unit, so they certainly won't be a burden to us on the way out. Gideon, you think that bag of your can hold enough?"""
962,Nightwing32193,"Gideon looks up from his bowl, ""Hm? Oh the bag. Aye, well there's only one way to find out isn't there?""he says, grinning."
963,Dragodar,"Demryon grins at Gideon. ""We'll need to find some weapons then. We may be able to pick some up in Farindahl once we're inside.""Uamm speaks up. ""We should act soon, but I won't be able to help. These people need a protector to get them to safety, and at the moment they have no one else.""Setting his bowl on the table, Seamus begins to speak slowly, a hesitant look on his face. ""that my particular skills could be exactly what they need. If you will stay and aid my companions, I can oversee the safe passage of these people to the closest city.""Uamm smiles, a pitying look flitting across his features. ""Thank you, boy. Your intentions are noble,"" he responds, casting a glance at the rest of the party. ""But I'm afraid you yet lack the stature required of a great warrior. Perhaps some day your ability will match to your spirit.""Seamus protests. ""You're wrong. I can protect these people better than you can,"" he says bluntly. Uamm looks around at the rest of the party with an awkward smile and continues in an unintentionally condescending tone: ""Of course you can, son. Tell you what, why don't you run outside and we'll discuss it? Your plan might just work.""Seamus sits still, unimpressed with Uamm's patronizing. He silently looks around at the rest of the party, smugly waiting for them to confirm his words.It is almost 2:00 PM on Wednesday, Iru 10th. The temperature is currently about 90* F outside, but closer to 70* F in the tent."
964,RealZachKraus,"Chadwick, who had up to this point been preoccupied with his food and wine, suddenly perked up, chuckling, ""I think you'll find the boy has more than a few tricks up his sleeve. I'd hear him out."" He takes another sip."
965,Dragodar,"Uamm looks from one companion to another, his face expression still doubtful.""The boy possesses ancient magic, the likes of which I've not seen.""The word of his compatriot is enough to put his doubts to bed. Uamm's face slowly changes as it dawns on him that there may be more to the boy than meets the eye. ""Ah,"" he says, clearing his throat slightly. ""Well in that case, perhaps his plan may actually work."" Uamm nods at Seamus. ""My apologies, young master. I did not mean to underestimate you.""""Eh, I'm used to it,"" Seamus says dismissively, shoveling another handful of food into his mouth. After several moments of silence interrupted only by the sound of eating, Uamm inquires of Seamus, ""What exactly is it you are capable of?""""But a lot,""Uamm looks up at the rest of the party. ""I'll need more information before I entrust the wellbeing of these people to a young boy, but I suppose we can discuss that later."""
966,Graehamkracker,"""Anyways. As for us, we sneak in, free prisoners, arm prisoners, sneak out, get seen, and fight the rest of the way? Sounds manageable, but no more <i>heroics."" Bendron aims the last line in Gideon's direction"
967,Nightwing32193,"Gideon squints his eyes and tilts his head slightly to the left, looking inquisitively at his Dwarvish companion, ""You got something you wanna fûckin' say mate?"" His tone was steady, but not wholly friendly."
968,Graehamkracker,"""What's our best way in? Any secret passages?"""
969,Nightwing32193,"Gideon shakes his head and goes back to his drink. Clearly somewhere between brooding and sulking. No one can quite tell. ""I risk my life for that fûcking dwarf and the rest of them so they can get out of that dungeon and I don't get so much as a ""thank you."" Well you can be damn sure thats the last time I'll be risking anything for any of them. Except Chadwick, obviously."
970,Dragodar,"Demryon shakes his head at Bendron's question. ""No secret ways in. The entire sewer system collects in one single sewer passage below the city which runs directly west to the ocean. That's nearly eight miles of sewage tunnel. There are three access points between the city and the ocean, but the closest one to the city is almost three miles out. Three miles tramping through sewer would kill us.""Uamm nods in agreement. ""If we didn't die underground; we would die an even slower death, days or weeks later. We'll have to figure out something cleverer. Sewer is out."""
971,Graehamkracker,"""Wait. You know what <i>might lead them to give up the walls: the thought of a large army marching by to ambush their other forces."""
972,Nightwing32193,"Gideon rolls his eyes and looks at the dwarf,""What can you tell us of the raiding parties that leave the city? Fûck a couple of them up really badly and they may just come out in force."""
973,Dragodar,"""The raiding parties have almost completely stopped. The orcs seems to be mounting a well organized campaign, and their raids have a taken a backseat. They do send scouting parties out now and then to establish a safe perimeter around the city. But typically they consist of no more than half a dozen riders per squadron. I doubt we would be able to withdraw five thousand well entrenched troops from a secure stronghold by attacking a few scouting parties,"" Uamm responds regretfully. ""Might be able to capture a few. But again, not sure what good that would do us."""
974,Graehamkracker,"""That's a good start, but I'm thinking bigger. Take out a few patrols, cause some discomfort, then have them watch an army's dust cloud rise and travel past the city on the horizon, headed to their forward ranks. We could make them think a whole army was travelling by, to surprise the forward forces, then they could be tricked into leaving."" "
975,Nightwing32193,"""That doesn't actually sound too bad. Beforehand maybe set up a makeshift camp for them to find. The few of us could make enough noise for a few hundred at least. The orcs wont risk anything going wrong with their campaign i think so this could work in drawing them out."""
976,Dragodar,"Demryon nods. ""Farindahl is still another six hours march from here. If we leave now, we'll reach the city around nightfall, and I can sneak in tonight. I'll go alone; I can move without undetected and I know the city best. If I can find my companions, we can put the plan into action tomorrow.""Uamm stands and crosses the tent. He opens a small chest that sits on a low table and withdraws an object about the size of a head. Returning to the table, he sets it down in front of Demryon. ""If you are to travel during the day, protect yourself from Aurín's fire."" The object is a stained wooden tub with no distinguishing markings or lettering. Uamm laughs heartily. ""It seems he has already deigned to kiss you today. Your faces look as though you've painted them red to frighten the Muors from Farindahl. That can't be comfortable.""Demryon grabs the tub and screws open the cap. Inside is a oily, pale white ointment. Demryon's eyes light up. ""Sunshield! Thank you Uamm, we've been in dire need.""It is just after 2:00 PM on Wednesday, Iru 10th."
977,Nightwing32193,"""Our trail rations are running low, Dem and I may want to do a bit of hunting before our next move."""
978,Dragodar,"""It contains minerals that prevent sunburn if you rub it into your skin before spending time outside. It also contains herbs that can soothe sunburn if you already have it. Very lovely stuff,"" Demryon says in response to Gideon query as he rubs a small amount of the ointment onto his face.After a moment of spreading the lotion across his flushed cheeks, Demryon proffers the wooden tub to Gideon and continues, ""I would be willing to do some hunting, brother."""
979,Graehamkracker,"""What do we have that could stir up an army's worth of dust... Maybe some magics?"""
980,Nightwing32193,"""Yeah, hold the fûck up for a second. Seamus, you lovely little bastard. I'm sure youre way more powerful then you've since let on please, can we have your input here mate?"""
981,Dragodar,"Seamus shakes his head dejectedly. ""Closest thing I could do would be to form some kind of cloud of fog,"" he adds, trying to be helpful."
982,Graehamkracker,"""Hmm. I was hoping for some gusts of wind. Maybe we could stir it up physically. Some animals, maybe?"" "
983,Nightwing32193,"""Thats just my thoughts anyways."" he mutters."
984,Dragodar,"""Summoning that alien beast in the cave was new. Not even sure how I did it, really. I'll have to keep practicing that. But if we find a herd of animals, I can influence them to do what we want. To an extent, at least,"" Seamus says as he munches on the chicken."
985,Graehamkracker,"""What, like practice against each other? That may not be a bad idea."""
986,Nightwing32193,"""Aye, practicing against each other."" he replies, not making eye contact, rather looking off in the distance, above Bendron's head."
987,Nightwing32193,"Then, as if just realizing the potential of his new idea, ""Seamus, lad, can u summon me a horse? One that won't disappear in a few minutes?"" "
988,Dragodar,"""I've been walking across fields and marshes and up mountains and through caves for almost a week now. If I could pull a horse out of thin air, I would have. I told you, that thing in the caves was new. I kept it around for less than a minute and it used up most of my energy for the day."""
989,Graehamkracker,"""Easy now, all these magics seem new to him too"""
990,Dragodar,"Seamus seems to think for a moment. ""Sorry,"" he says, apologizing for the first time since they've met."
991,Nightwing32193,"Gideon shrugs, nodding at the boy. Turning to Chadwick, ""You wanna arm wrestle?"" he asks."
992,Graehamkracker,"""So we take a moment to hunt, resupply, spar, recon, and find a herd to use before we spring the prisoners?"""
993,Dragodar,"""But will Seamus be staying with these elves as they seek refuge or will he be accompanying us on our mission? I believe that, despite the boy's undeniable power, Uamm would be more use to us in this endeavor, simply due to his knowledge of the city and his experience. Seamus can do some marvellous things, certainly, but his magic will be little use against five thousand orcs."""
994,Graehamkracker,"""If we're going to use a herd of whatever we can find, I'm sure that we could rile them up enough without him. Besides, I need to get some stories from your friend."""
995,Dragodar,"The ragtag band of intrepid adventurers spend the rest of the day with Uamm and the elves, resting and conserving their strength. At Uamm's request, Seamus and Demryon accompany him on a walk away from the camp so that Seamus can demonstrate his ability. By the time they return, Uamm is comfortable leaving his companions in the care of the young lad. That night, the adventurers sleep soundly.=============The next morning, Seamus bids farewell to his friends and heads north with the elves. The rest of the group, plus Uamm, head south and east, toward Farindahl. As they travel, Uamm and Demryon describe to them the indricothere, a massive, thick skinned beast that travels in large herds. From the sound of it, the indricothere could fit their purposes nicely. They are typically very gentle creatures, but can be riled into a stampede if they sense danger.Over the course of their journey, they see two herds of these creatures in the distance. After about four hours of determined marching with minimal breaks, the weary travelers see the city of Farindahl on the horizon. Several small plumes of dark smoke rise from within its walls. Estimating its distance, it appears to be a little over three miles away.The sun hangs high in the cloudless, azure sky. Several large birds circle lazily far overhead. The world around them is quiet except for the incessant buzzing of insects. Many creatures seem to have taken shelter from the sun during these hot midday hours; the sleepiness of the landscape contrasts sharply with the party's acute awareness of Farindahl's proximity and the closeness of the orc army.They are getting close enough that they may soon be in danger of running across scouting parties, if they are not already.It is just after noon on Thursday Iru 11th."
996,Graehamkracker,"""So who's going to be sneaking in while the rest of us nap out here? And we still need to trade some stories."" Bendron aims the last bit at Uamm"
997,Nightwing32193,"""I can move unseen if need be, although I'd figure Demryon for this task."""
998,Dragodar,"""You should make camp here. Keep a keen eye out for orcs. I should be back around nightfall.""With that, the ranger heads toward the city. =============As the company makes camp, Uamm tells Bendron of the tales he heard from his grandfather.""From what my grandfather told me, the Yundri endured a terrible fate,"" Uamm begins. ""Bovurum was the fearless leader who managed to lead the last survivors from the ruins of the Yundri city of Argŵr. It was said that Urdin Frömaðurhínn had perfected the Arcane science of Stasis... but my grandfather thought that was a myth. It is clear he was wrong.""Uamm pauses as he hammers a pair of stakes into the ground and pulls a thin knit tarp over them to form a small, low to the ground lean-to. He crawls underneath it and lies on his back, resting in the shade. The rest of the companions set up their own preparations."
999,Graehamkracker,"""Fearless leader, ruins, and last survivors.... I wonder how much of that was embellishment over time and how much came from Bovurum. He had been sent out with some others to find a way out - I think most saw it as a likely fruitless effort, but there were only so many viable ideas. Sure would've been nice if they'd let is all know there was some way out."""
1000,Nightwing32193,Gideon looks up at the sun. Wiping his brow he removes his hide breastplate and shirt. Beads of sweat already are rolling down his neck and upper back.
1001,Dragodar,"""From the stories I heard, Bovurum and his crew found the way out and returned to fetch his people. At that point, Urdin and the Yundri Abjurers had already placed four of their kind in stasis and sealed them away in protected chambers. By the time Bovurum and his men returned with knowledge of the way out, the mountain was already collapsing and there was no time to save those who had been placed in stasis.""Uamm pauses, looking slightly apologetic. ""I'm guessing you were one of those who could not be saved?""As Gideon removes his thick hide armor, you see a wooden amulet hanging from his neck on a silver chain. Though you only catch a glance of it, you see that the wooden locket is inlaid with fine golden filigree in the shape of a Cornucopia, the symbol of the woodland goddess Ehlonna."
1002,Graehamkracker,"""Huh. Guess it took much longer than we'd thought to find a path out. Also, only four? Before I was put to sleep, I had been led to believe that there would be quite a few of us."""
1003,Nightwing32193,"Gideon chuckles, ""Seems they forgot ya Ben. I wouldn't have it any other way."" he says, winking at the dwarf."
1004,Dragodar,"Uamm nods at Bendron's inquiry. ""There is a shrine to the Forgotten Four called the Dómur Fjórgleym, in Thandos in the Nordin Mountains. Bovurum had it constructed once his people arrived and settled. Their names are written in the sanctuary, but only Đwérgir of the Yundri line are allowed inside, so nobody else knows who they were. At this point though, most of the Yundri have intermarried with the Thandi, so there are few left who are granted access to the Dómur Fjórgleym. My father has seen it once before... from the outside of course."""
1005,Nightwing32193,"Gideon squints, shading his eyes from the sun he scans the terrain around them. After a few short minutes he un shoulders his greatsword and draws the smaller one from his waist. Walking about one hundred feet from the others he bends down and inspects the ground, he walks a few feet and repeats this action til hes made a full perimeter check around their makeshift campsite.  Spot/search check then a survival check for tracks/disturbed terrain."
1006,Graehamkracker,"""Hm. That seems worth a visit. What of Bovurum's fate?"""
1007,Dragodar,"""As far as I know, he lived out his days in Thandos and died there. I've heard that he sent multiple search parties to the Sudrin Mountains to find the Fjórgleym, but they were all unsuccessful. Not sure if that's true or not."" Uamm reaches into his pack and pulls out a small nut bar from his ration pack. He munches on it thoughtfully as the buzz of cicadas echoes across the plains.You wouldn't need a Search check to find tracks since Survival covers that. You could use either one but since your Survival modifier is higher I assume you want to use that one.Survival: (1d20+5)11As you carefully study the ground around the campsite, you discover large canine tracks. You recognize them as Uulfer tracks. Uulferi are the favored mounts of the Muorish warriors, as you recall from your days fighting them. The tracks you find appear to be several days old. It looks as though between four and eight Uulferi traversed this area. Likely a scouting party.=============Soon, the sun is sinking toward the western horizon. The sapphire blue sky is fading fast to a deep purple, and the sun sends brilliant pink and orange streaks across the plains. The buzz of the cicadas is joined by the chirping of frogs, and the warmth of midday gradually gives way to the cool of evening. A murmuration of starlings swoops overhead, ebbing and flowing like a living cloud as the small birds dip and weave to catch their dinner of insects. Far in the distance, a wolf or jackal howls at the faintly brightening moon.Uamm sits next to his bag and withdraws a small whetstone from it. He begins to run it smoothly up and down his blade in a mesmerizing fashion. ""Lord Demryon should be back soon,"" he murmurs to nobody in particular. He begins to quietly hum a tune as he sharpens his sword. The blade seems to glow softly in the rising moonlight.It is about 8:00 PM on Thursday, Iru 11th."
1008,Nightwing32193,"Gideon returns to the campsite and sits down next to Chad, ""I found some tracks. Looks like a scouting party. Bad news and worse news. Which would you like first?"" he asks, his countenance was pleasant, but his tone grave."
1009,Graehamkracker,"""Oh, not this again. Just spit it out, no need to stew on it'"
1010,Nightwing32193,"Gideon rolls his eyes, shakes his head, and cracks a wry smile, ""Fûck right off mate. Anyways, the bad news is, the tracks are a few days old, seems they may be back sooner rather then later. The worse news is they're mounted. And their steeds are...well they're formidable to say the least."""
1011,Dragodar,"""Yes, the Uulferi are not the prettiest creatures,"" Uamm interjects. ""But from what we've seen, the Muors send scouting parties out every week or so. They'll send four parties out, one in each of the cardinal directions. Each party establishes a five mile perimeter from the city in their quadrant, which means each party has to cover roughly 60 square miles during their recon. If they were to cover every mile of that thoroughly, it would take them almost a week.""Uamm pauses and takes a long drink from his canteen before screwing the cap back on and continuing.""From all of our recon, we've determined that the scouting parties stay in the field for no more than one day, tops. Undisciplined swine,"" Uamm spits on the ground for emphasis. ""So we can safely bet that they won't be passing over this area with a fine toothed comb. Once we get within a mile of the city, it's a different story. But for now we should be fine."""
1012,Nightwing32193,"""So I see not much has changed since our last meeting. Where do they keep their creatures? Maybe we could force them to spook and use that as a distraction to get closer to the city. Just a thought."" Gideon says as he pulls a wetstone from his havversack and begins sharpening his greatsword. Once he's satisfied with its edge, he moves on to his shortsword, then finally his dagger. He turns to Bendron and offers him the stone."
1013,Graehamkracker,"Bendron takes it, with a face of what may be interest or confusion as he turns it over in his hands. ""We may have to set up some sort of trap to even entice the patrol."" The inspection, or his musings, seems to leave him displeased."
1014,Nightwing32193,"""What now?"" Gideon asks, his tone bordering on exasperation."
1015,Graehamkracker,"""I don't get it. I don't see any difference."""
1016,Nightwing32193,"Gideon smiles, ""Mind if I take a look at your long axe for a minute?"""
1017,Graehamkracker,Bendron draws the halberd over his shoulder and passes it along.
1018,Dragodar,"Bendron hands the halberd to Gideon. Its construction is entirely stone, expertly wrought and in perfect condition. It is pristinely well maintained and is extraordinarily sharp, with smooth, burgundy leather grips."
1019,Nightwing32193,"""Incredible weapon, mate. Truly!"""
1020,Graehamkracker,"""Aye, it's a proper fighting tool - much better than those metal bars you all swing around. Sung from the mountain itself.... Are there still Earthshapers around?"" He directs that last bit at Uamm as he sets the halberd across his lap, running fingers along the blade for a second before returning both hands to the long hilt."
1021,Nightwing32193,"""I dunno, have a feel.""  Gideon expertly twirls his greatsword around until the hilt is at Bendon's nose. He winks."
1022,Dragodar,"Uamm shakes his head in wonder as he looks at the dwarf. ""You truly are from an age long past, aren't you?"" His voice betrays genuine bemusement and no ill will. ""My friend, It has been many, many years since <i>The Art has been wielded in these lands. That boy who came with you was one of a kind, as far as what I've seen, and I've been around for five hundred years. The arcane energy of this world has been fast fading. What little of it I've seen was performed by my father when I was but a young boy."""
1023,Graehamkracker,"Bendron stands up and takes the sword, taking a few swings. ""I'd been gathering as much, but have not felt such a fading myself. I'm very curious to know what's been causing all these changes."""
1024,Nightwing32193,Gideon rolls his eyes.  What the actual **** is with this guy?
1025,Graehamkracker,"(1d20-3)7""But then again, a hammer's well timed blows would suit most jobs.""Bendron sits and waits in the shade, oblivious as usual to the foreign cues around him."
1026,Dragodar,"""Swords are not so clumsy when wielded in the hands of an artist, Master Bendron."" He draws a long, slender blade from the sheath on his back and twirls in nimbly between his fingers. It seems to dance and take on a life of its own as he effortlessly runs it through a series of motions, while still lying on the ground. Without ceasing his deft swirling of the blade, he rises to his feet. Despite staying almost completely stationary, Uamm swings the blade around in a series of dizzying movements -- over his head, behind his back, under his legs -- switching hands at times without even being observable. It is almost difficult to distinguish where the blade meets his hand as he slides gracefully through the maneuvers. The sword seems to move of its own accord, with Uamm merely spectating. As quickly as it began, the demonstration is over, and Uamm takes a seat on the ground next to his pack."
1027,Nightwing32193,"Gideon turns to Chad and whispers, ""The fûck is the dwarf's issue mate?""Gideon soon completely ignores the dwarf as a look of awe and admiration crosses his face. As he watches the elf a tingling feeling of jealousy creeps into his mind. Not one to let these feelings eat at him, he addresses the elf, ""Would it be possible to learn from you? Such speed and precision may come in handy. Someday.""  The emphasis on the last word seems to be directed more at the rolling plains then to the elf."
1028,Dragodar,"""What's that? Looks like some forest goddess mumbo jumbo.""Uamm frowns slightly, then looks off in the direction of Farindahl, deep in thought. ""I've only ever been a student of the Sublime Way. But I suppose I could teach it... I've never tried before though.""Uamm's movements are both recognizable and foreign. You've never seen a style like his before, but there is a ring of familiarity about his poise. You recognize a few specific moves from disciplines such as Diamond Mind and Iron Heart, but you see many more maneuvers that are completely unfamiliar to you -- movements that look nothing like anything a warblade would ever use. You note with interest that you see nothing at all from Stone Dragon or White Raven.When Uamm mentions ""The Sublime Way"" you have a mental flashback to something your mentor, Kenstríð, used to say when teaching you the ways of the halberd. ""You will never stumble if you follow the Sublime Way. For you cannot lose the path if the path is within you.""Still though, very little about the elf's movements is reminiscent of the Warblade training. Even as you wrack your brain, you are unable to recognize his training. He is a student of another vocation, a pupil of a different calling."
1029,Nightwing32193,"Gideon frowns, ""Sublime, what's Sumblime?"""
1030,Graehamkracker,"Bendron perks up a bit as the conversation shifts. ""I'm not sure you'll have much success teaching him philosophy"""
1031,Dragodar,"Uamm smiles at Bendron. ""There is far more to the Sublime Way than simply philosophy, cáraí, though that is part of it. It is an ancient school of martial study, divided into three distinct persuasions and consisting of nine disciplines. It has been handed down from ages long past."""
1032,Graehamkracker,"""Aye, I'm familiar with bits of it - though it seems like I'm lacking in others."""
1033,Dragodar,"Uamm looks at Bendron with interest. ""Oh? I was not aware that the Way had reached the Yundri before their demise. Do you know who it was who brought the teachings to your people? And when?"""
1034,Graehamkracker,"""I'd learned from one called Kenstríð, who likely learned from someone before him. He was one of the elders, more a thinker than a fighter."""
1035,Dragodar,"""Ahh,"" Uamm says, nodding. ""So it had been in your traditions for a long time then. Tell me, which persuasion is that you studied in?"""
1036,Graehamkracker,"""Philosophy, mostly. He talked a lot about following the path and the path in your self."""
1037,Dragodar,"My apologies, Uamm says with a kind smile. I was not clear. Did you study as a warblade, a swordsage, or a crusader?"
1038,Nightwing32193,"Gideon sits cross legged, listening intently."
1039,Graehamkracker,"""Warblade, but there was a disconnect between the martial training and the philosophy of the Way. Didn't know they were the same thing until today."""
1040,Nightwing32193,"""Whats all this about philosophy now? I'm asking to swing a sword."""
1041,RealZachKraus,"Chadwick chimes in ""I'm with my boy over here. Philosophy has one purpose, wooing women. And noble though that purpose may be! I'll leave it off the battlefield."""
1042,Nightwing32193,"""Wel hold up now Chad. I wanna hear em out once."""
1043,Dragodar,"""They are two sides of the same coin,"" the elf says. ""You cannot think of them as two separate things, but as two aspects of the same thing: the person. A man consists of mind, body, and spirit. To ignore any of these is to be incomplete. Would you run with only one leg, or lift with only one arm?"" Uamm asks. ""To truly master his weapon, a man must master himself. You cannot hope to acheive your full potential on the battlefield if you drill and train with your sword, but not with your mind. All of these things are necessary for balance. If you take a stool with three legs and cut one of them off, the stool will collapse. People are the same. No man can follow the Sublime Way if he does not embrace his trinitarian nature.""Uamm turns to Chad and responds with a chuckle, ""We're talking about philosophy, cáraí. You may be thinking of philandering -- something entirely different to be sure."""
1044,Nightwing32193,"Gideon stares blankly at the elf. Then stands up and respectfully motions him away from the rest. ""I need your help. Please teach me. I cannot retake my throne with the skills I've built up in my short time. I need more. And I think the answer lies with you, mate."""
1045,Dragodar,"Uamm follows the barbarian a few steps away and they converse in low voices for a few moments.Uamm speaks slowly, choosing his words deliberately. ""If you are willing to attend to all three dimensions of yourself... to focus fully on each but never at the expense of another... to build all three pillars of your craft and keep your eyes at all times on your destination -- the perfect version of yourself... Then I may be able to teach you what I know. But this depends far more on your willingness to learn than on my willingness to teach.""The elf pauses. ""I must tell you though; I am not a master of the Sublime Way. I am a swordsage. I study but one persuasion of the school."""
1046,Graehamkracker,"""Why the secrets? We're all on the same side here."" Bendron calls out as the pair separate themselves."
1047,Nightwing32193,"Gideon turns to the dwarf, ""I'm hearing your words and I'm willing to learn. I'm just confused as to how there's more to swinging a sword then swinging a sword."""
1048,Dragodar,"Uamm adresses Gideon, loud enough for the rest of the group to hear. ""Master Dwarf has a point, cáraí. Is there any particular reason we're standing over here? Surely there's nothing about this conversation that the others cannot hear?"""
1049,Graehamkracker,"""We've all got some questions - may as well let our friend answer them each once rather than three times."""
1050,Nightwing32193,"FOR DRAMATIC AFFECT OK???""The last time I saw sword strokes like that was when I lost my tribe to a usurper in single combat. I figure if I can train and learn, maybe next time he wont be so lucky."" "
1051,Graehamkracker,"""Single combat? Is that how your people choose a leader?"" Bendron asks Gideon, incredulous."
1052,Nightwing32193,"""The Ul Vadr follow strength. When my father was banished, I challenged the usurper, Genji to a duel. I was but a lad at the time."" "
1053,Graehamkracker,"""And if you'd beaten him, a boy'd have been in charge? A strong boy, but a boy nonetheless?"""
1054,Nightwing32193,"""I challenged him out of anger and sorrow. I know now that I wasnt ready to lead. But it was my father's tribe and my grandfather's before him. I'm sure you would have done the same for your family's honor?"""
1055,Graehamkracker,"""I'm not surprised by your action - that probably was the best thing to do, if what you described happened. I'm surprised that your people would have followed you just because you were a better fighter than the last leader. How would you keep the best fighters from all killing each other? And what makes a good fighter a good leader?"""
1056,Nightwing32193,"""That's so many questions Ben. I was away on a campaign when it all happened. It was most likely more then a single duel that undermined my father's power. Originally it was respect for my family that kept the tribe following him. I cant say what happened."" "
1057,Graehamkracker,"""That makes a bit more sense. But anyways, back to philosophy: what's the difference between Warblades and those other two groups - the crusaders and sageswords?"" Bendron turns to Uamm for the question"
1058,Dragodar,"Uamm listens with interest as the barbarian and the dwarf converse, then perks up at Bendron's question.""Swordsages,"" Uamm says, kindly correcting the dwarf's mistake. ""And to answer your question...  Tactics and style, ostensibly speaking. But truly, at their core? It is the philosophical mission of each persuasion that set them apart."" Uamm pauses and opens a skin of Greybriar wine. He takes a long swig and continues. ""Crusaders, much like paladins,"" he begins, gesturing at Chad, ""focus on prayer and their devotion to an ideal in order to strengthen their resolve, inform their instincts, and protect them from even the deadliest onslaughts. Warblades,"" he continues, with a nod to Bendron, ""focus on maintaining maximum athletic strength and improving their weapon skill to the point of absolute perfection, so as to be fully in their element in mortal combat. They revel in being physically superior and more intensively trained with their weapons than anyone else."" ""And swordsages,"" he says, turning to Gideon, ""focus on increasing their knowledge of combat until they are as intimately acquainted with it as an old lover. A swordsage wants to know his enemy better than his enemy knows himself, in order to move with unmatched speed and cunning."" Uamm draws his sword and gazes lovingly at the blade as he gently runs his fingers up the side of it. ""To a swordsage, speed is power, and the more instinctive his movements, the less time he wastes thinking about what to do. When combat is so finely ingrained into his being that he speaks it better than he speaks the tongue of his forefathers, a swordsage is at peace.""Uamm looks around at the companions with a curious smile, as though studying them. ""As you might have picked up, the three persuasions of the Sublime Way even seem to mirror the threefold nature of man. The Sublime Way teaches the balance of all three aspects, and the persuasions within it reflect that balance. Crusaders are the soul, warblades are the body, and swordsages are the mind. That's not doctrine, but I've always thought it seemed intentional.""Uamm pauses with a slight frown as though to reconsider what he's said, then clarifies, ""That being said, it is still essential for any student of one of the persuasions to direct his full attention to all three aspects of his person. I don't mean to imply that the focus is on one over the others depending on the persuasion. It's just an interesting way of looking at the Sublime Way and its trinitarian structure.""Taking another swig from the wineskin, he holds it out, offering it to anyone. ""I, cáraía mión, am a swordsage. I studied under El Khesim, the eight hundred and ninety first grandmaster of Rafía Sadâh, the Sublime Temple. I have been a student of the Way for many years now. But as I said before, I've never taught it.""Uamm continues to study the blade of his sword, occasionally using the cuff of his sleeve to rub invisible smudges off of it."
1059,Graehamkracker,"""Do any of your people who take up the Way become crusaders or warblades? Or would they all learn to become swordsages?"""
1060,Dragodar,"Uamm imperceptibly starts from his reverie as he looks up from his blade, as though not expecting Bendron's question. ""My people? Oh, few if any Audari study the Sublime Way. Rafía Sadâh lies across the Dydocan, in Alharra, far to the west. There are elves there too, though unlike any elves of Aezelon. And men and dwarves as well. The nations of Alharra do not divide themselves by race, but by another means known only to themselves."" Uamm takes another drink of wine.""The Rafía Sadâh stands in the northern reaches of Alharra's northernmost nation, Qassam. The Sublime Way is more than a school of combat for the Qassamar. It is a way of life. A religion, a philosophy. An art, a science. It knits the threads of their very culture together. Their warriors follow all three persuasions, in almost equal numbers. Their way of life displays the balance they so lovingly follow in the Way. I spent many years in Alharra, but that was a long time ago,"" Uamm concludes, with a wistful, almost mournful look on his face.As Uamm finishes speaking, a dark hooded figure suddenly appears in their midst, seemingly materializing out of the night air. ""Do I have some news for you lads,"" Demryon says, throwing his hood back.The Dydocan Ocean is the ocean to the west of Aezelon. To the east is the Ordan Ocean. North is the Voriborean Sea. South is the Merinodan Sea."
1061,Graehamkracker,"Bendron holds a hand up in Demrons direction, but otherwise ignores him. ""You still have that which you miss. Nourish it, make it your own, and share it with whomever you find needing. Nothing dies unless you let it fade."""
1062,Dragodar,"Uamm smiles at the dwarf and looks at him briefly with a searching squint, as though noticing something new about him. Thank you, Bendron. I must confess I always heard that the Yundri were a coarse people, as gray and stoic as the stone they lived in. But if you are any indication, it seems there was more to your people than the stories say,"" the grizzled elf says. ""We may yet make a philospher of you, Master Đwérgun, he finishes with a barking laugh.What news, Demryon? Uamm asks, turning to his elven comrade.Demryon looks from Bendron to Uamm and back. Permission to speak, Master Đwérgun? he asks."
1063,Nightwing32193,"Gideon has sat the entire time. Listening intently to the elf, not saying a word. As Demryon appears, he turn is attention towards him, awaiting the news."
1064,Graehamkracker,"""Whenever you're ready."""
1065,Dragodar,"""The barbarism of the Muors works in our favor today, cáraía mión. They are using my companions for slave labor, which means they've kept them alive. All eight of them. Time to start planning a rescue, lads."" A smile graces Demryon's weary features as he mentions his friends, but quickly fades. He takes a few steps toward Uamm and accepts the wineskin from the grey haired elf. Taking a deep swig, he replaces the cap and continues his report. ""--found my Falcons in the northwest garrison yard. The orcs have had them on farming duty for the last few weeks. Not entirely unusual for an invading army; soldiers have to eat after all. ""But here's where it gets strange: I managed to talk to Naeva for a few brief moments. She said that there isn't much they've been able to find out since they've only been in the garrison and the farmyard for the last few weeks. But on multiple occasions they've caught glimpses of Muorish women and children walking the streets of the city. Beyond that even, they've overheard their orc captors talking at times. The Muors don't know that my Falcons speak orcish so they aren't exactly tight lipped around them. Naeva and the others have heard them drop little phrases like 'going home to the family tonight,' or 'teach my boy a lesson after a stunt like that' so the only conclusion we can think of is that the orcs have been moving caravans of civilians into Farindahl. Why on earth would an invasion force be bringing civilians to the front lines?"""
1066,Nightwing32193,"""Well I think its quite obvious. The Mours are attempting to colonize  Aezelon by the sound of it."" Gideon responds in a matter of a fact voice."
1067,Graehamkracker,"""Colonizing, or fleeing?"""
1068,Nightwing32193,"""What do you mean?"""
1069,RealZachKraus,"Chadwick spits in disgust ""Colonizing is sure a kind term for it. More likely they just raped their own land barren and need resources. We can and will not share land with these animals."""
1070,Nightwing32193,"Gideon nods in agreement, but turns back to the dwarf, awaiting an explanation."
1071,Dragodar,"Uamm frowns and gazes in the direction of Farindahl, thinking intently. Demryon stares distantly at the ground, also deep in thought."
1072,Graehamkracker,"Eventually Bendron notices Gideon's gaze. ""Fleeing? Like trying to escape something."""
1073,Nightwing32193,"Gideon chuckles,""I know what the word means, mate. Just seems unlikely I think."""
1074,Graehamkracker,"""So did the presence of orcish families, until a couple moments ago."""
1075,Nightwing32193,"Gideon's eyes widen as the dwarf's point dawns on him, ""Oh, OH. Shît. Well doesnt surprise me though. Orcs tend to invite unsavory guests wherever they go. Even more filthy then themselves."""
1076,RealZachKraus,"Chadwick is still not convinced. ""The simplest explanation is oftentimes the correct one. Either way, let's deal with the enemy at our door before we start chasing phantoms."""
1077,Dragodar,"Demryon nods at Chadwick's words. ""I'll second that,"" he says, nodding at the paladin.Uamm strokes the stubble on his chin, still squinting at Farindahl in the distance. ""Yes, I suppose that's a good point... But still, worrying...""""So. Time to plan this rescue?"" Demryon looks from one companion to another expectantly. Uamm turns to the group and uncorks the wineskin, slugging heavily from it."
1078,RealZachKraus,"""How we getting in my man?"""
1079,Graehamkracker,"""At nightfall?"""
1080,Nightwing32193,"""A blitz attack during the day while they're working will be our best bet. Mid afternoon while the guards are sluggish and full from the mid day meal. We'll use the heat to our advantage that way as well."""
1081,Graehamkracker,"""I just can't stand this sun. It's so much worse than I'd imagined."""
1082,Nightwing32193,"""Aye, but they don't like it anymore then you do, mate. But you have the constitution to see it through. They don't."""
1083,Dragodar,"""You want to just rush in there and grab them...? In the middle of the day...? Is this your typical strategy for situations like this?"" Uamm asks, a bewildered look on his face. The pale moonlight illuminates his features as he stares bemusedly at Gideon.Demryon glances uncomfortably from Gideon to Uamm and back. ""Um, well there's a bit more that I learned. Let's sit and discuss, shall we?""The young elf plops himself down in the middle of the encampment and looks up at his companions expectantly, waiting for them to join him."
1084,Nightwing32193,"""Ya knooow..."" Gideon's voice trails off as he sits down next to Demryon."
1085,Graehamkracker,"""He's a big fan of rushing in places."" Bendron says as he sits and joins the group"
1086,Nightwing32193,"Gideon laughs and shakes his head, ""Chad's mother loves it.""he says, winking at the Paladin in an attept to lighten the mood."
1087,RealZachKraus,"Using his unarmored left hand, Chadwick punches Gideon right in his fvcking face."
1088,Dragodar,"Chadwick Unarmed Strike:(1d20+6)18Gideon Reflex Saving Throw: (1d20+4)15Before Gideon can react, Chadwick's fist makes contact with his nose, sending searing pain through his face.

1089,Nightwing32193,"""ARE YOU. FÛCKING. KIDDING ME!"" Gideon screams as the sight of his own blood awakens something inside him. ""I'm done with you fûcks."" he says. Shouldering his equipment and striking off west."
1090,Dragodar,"""Back do da dask ad had. Whad's our blay?

The barbarian's feet make contact with the paladin's shins and send him sprawling to his face. Standing up and wiping from blood from his face with his forearm, Gideon stares down at Chadwick and shouts hoarsely, ""I'b dud wid you fûcks."" He swings his pack over his shoulder and grabs his greatsword, then storms off, heading west.You take 6 HP of nonlethal damage. You are currently at 6/32 NL. At 16/36 you will become <i>Staggered."
1091,Graehamkracker,"Bendron stays seated, evaluating the pair as they scuffle, but calls out as Gideon marches off. ""You're under contract."""
1092,Nightwing32193,"Gideon stops. Wiping more blood from his face he looks up at the sky.  spot and listen check He slowly turns and walks back, ""You're right Ben. I owe Demryon that much anyway."""
1093,Dragodar,"The moon shines brightly, illuminating the surrounding countryside. Far away, on the horizon, you can see the twinkling lights of Farindahl. There are several clouds in the sky but for the most part it is a very clear night. The sound of crickets and frogs echo in your ears as a cool breeze ruffles your hair."
1094,Graehamkracker,"""What else did you learn?"" Bendron asks Demryon as Gideon returns to the group."
1095,Dragodar,"""Well there's one more big thing: it isn't just orcs in the city. Naeva also mentioned that several caravans of foreign humans have entered the city in the last few weeks, carrying an unknown cargo. She didn't know anything else, except that there are humans, from somewhere other than Aezelon, who are apparently allied with the Muors.""Demryon smiles and turns to Gideon. ""Didn't you say something about sneaking in with a caravan?"""
1096,Nightwing32193,"""Yeah. Like 20 fûcking minutes ago."" snaps Gideon, still wiping blood from his face."
1097,Dragodar,"""Well actually it was yesterday afternoon but given that bump you've just had we won't fault you for forgetting,"" says Demryon with a hearty laugh."
1098,Nightwing32193,"""What's the fûcking plan?"""
1099,Dragodar,"""You should rest,"" Uamm tells Gideon. ""As a matter of fact, we all should,"" he adds, addressing the group.""We'll need to discuss this tomorrow anyway, since we can't make a move tonight. Whatever we decide, we'll have to get Demryon in there at least once more before we act, so that the Falcons are on the same page. If we're going to rescue them, we'll want them in on the plan. For now, we need sleep."""
1100,Graehamkracker,"""Aye, some rest and training could do us good."""
1101,Nightwing32193,Gideon makes camp away from the rest. Having cleaned up most of the blood he lies with his hands behind his head looking up at the sky. Listening to the night.
1102,BeefyChickens,"""Get your training in tonight, if you must, while it's cool. You can sleep tomorrow during the day while I sneak back into Farindahl for more recon."""
1103,Dragodar,"""Alright,"" Uamm says, ""Why don't the two of you spar for a bit? So I can get an idea of your skills and styles."" He gestures for Bendron and Gideon to engage."
1104,Graehamkracker,"Bendron laughs. ""Pitting the dwarf against the bloody beserker? You sure you don't want him for yourself?"""
1105,Nightwing32193,"""I'll fight you both. I don't give a fûck."""
1106,Graehamkracker,"Bendron stands up and stretches. ""Ok, how are we doing this? Blunted edges or wood?"""
1107,Nightwing32193,"""I think wood would be best."" Unless one of you lot already carry around dull weapons."" "
1108,Dragodar,"Uamm crosses the camp with a few quick strides to the tree near their lean-tos and wrenches two branches off of its dry frame. Producing an elegant knife from his belt, he quickly shaves off the nubs and twigs until the branches are relatively smooth. The two sticks are each about six feet long. ""Shorten them if you want, but those should do reasonably well for now."""
1109,Graehamkracker,"Bendron takes the staff and holds it as a glaive as he runsthough a few practice paces. ""This will do well enough."""
1110,Nightwing32193,"Gideon does the same but as if it were a long sword, ""You ready, Master Dwarf?"""
1111,Graehamkracker,"""Let's see how this goes"" Bendron replies, as he takes some 20 paces (20ish feet) away to clear some space."
1112,Nightwing32193,Gideon raises his stick in a salute and prepares for combat.

He sits down between Gideon and Chadwick, imitating the barbarian's cross legged position as he anticipates the next round of fighting.""He's very modest, so you would never know it from his own lips, but Uamm is the greatest swordsman in Farindahl, and is very widely considered one of the three most skilled Audari elves alive today."" Demryon pauses, watching Uamm with admiration evident in his eyes as the older elf tests the weight of the crude wooden sword. ""The power of the Sublime Way is no mere exaggeration; Uamm wields magic unknown to most in Aezelon. I've witnessed it with my own eyes only once; and I've never seen anything like it since.""He glances at Chadwick. ""Except maybe for your healing spells. And the shít that boy pulled in the caves...

The mvement was so smooth and fast that Bendron is unsure if he tripped over Uamm's foot or his own.Uamm turns toward the dwarf, staff held in front of him in the same fencing stance, this time with his left hand hovering lightly in the air at eye level. ""Often it is speed and timing that outmatch raw power."" He says, waiting for the dwarf to rise."

1152,Graehamkracker,"Leaving the splintered stick on the ground, Bendron takes the hand and rises. ""You can only use what you have. I'm just glad I got a solid hit in."""
1153,Dragodar,"""A solid hit indeed,"" Uamm says with a bark of laughter, before instantly regretting his laugh and clutching his side.""You both show great promise. That means you too, Master Gideon. Despite your defeat I saw great potential in your style. I suppose I could teach you both a few maneuvers that may set you on the Path."""
1154,Nightwing32193,"Gideon's stares blankly. Taking time to let the elf's words sink in, ""Please."""
1155,Graehamkracker,"""What was that fancy light trick?"""
1156,Dragodar,"Uamm smiles at Bendron's question and addresses the group. ""The Sublime Way is the way of the Old Magic. Through our study, adepts of the Way are able to grasp and wield tiny fragments of the Creation Song to manipulate the very fibers of existence itself. The magic that you hear about in the stories was New Magic; arcane magic.  New Magic hasn't been seen in many years because the latent arcane energy that it utilizes has been steadily waning. But the Old Magic is the magic of the Creator. There are very few alive today who even know of the existence of the Old Magic.""Uamm looks at Bendron and addresses him specifically. ""That may indeed be why your study of the Sublime Way was so limited. I would not be at all surprised if your mentor knew only the physical movements of the body, and was entirely unaware of the metaphysical movements of the soul. If he only taught you to swing your halberd, he may well have imparted a valuable lesson. But he did not truly teach you the Way if he was not able to tutor you in singing the harmonies of the Creation Song. The Sublime Way is as much prayer as it is fighting."""
1157,Nightwing32193,"Gideon stares blankly,""I'm sorry. What was that all about?"""
1158,Graehamkracker,"""You'll understand if we're skeptical."""
1159,Nightwing32193,"""Your gods have caused me nothing but pain and loss."""
1160,Dragodar,"""You misunderstand me,"" Uamm says to Bendron. ""It's not that praying makes you a better fighter, although that may be true in its own right. It's that the world of the mind and the world of the soul are as real as the world of the body. We live in all three simultaneously, so to give attention to only one is to live incompletely."""
1161,Graehamkracker,"""Yes, the gods think you so important to ruin every bit of your life in particular, through no fault of your own or actions of others."" Bendron replies, dripping his words in a very Dwarven facimile of sarcasm that is nearly unrecognizable as such.(1d20-2)8"
1162,RealZachKraus,"Chadwick rolls his eyes in Gideon's direction, ""Seems very vague and misleading bud."""
1163,Dragodar,"""You should worship Aurín. He typically doesn't ruin your life unless you deserve it,"" Demryon chimes in cheerily.""The gods are merely the servants of the Creator,"" Uamm says. He turns away from the group and strides over to his bedroll, where he lays down after removing his belt and sheath. ""But now I am turning in for the night, so I will leave you to your arguments. Just try to keep the volume low if you don't mind."" With that, he rolls over and closes his eyes."
1164,Nightwing32193,"""Any good in my life was because I made it so. I've never asked a thing from any of them. But they saw fit to take what was most precious in life to me."" "
1165,Graehamkracker,"""The gods <i>took it from you? I thought that someone else caused all this, this object of hatred you have. How can you hate this man and yet blame all your hardships on the gods?"""

1168,Nightwing32193,"Gideon stands up, eyes blazing,""I did not ask for my family to be murdered to appease your fûcking gods. But they were. And then  paid with their lives. Now tell me, what man would follow entities who demand that kind of homage? You can keep your fûcking gods, and trinkets, and spells. Let me die in battle next time.""  he walks from camp back to his gear in yet another hissy fit."
1169,Graehamkracker,"""Serve? I couldn't imagine how the gods would want to be served, if that were even in my power. The gods do what gods do, and folk do what folk do."""
1170,Dragodar,"""Just to be clear, are you trying to avenge your family and retake your kingdom or die gloriously before you can achieve that? The way I see it, you'll have to pick one.""He then turns back to Bendron: ""An interesting view of the gods. One I admit I had not considered. Though I'm sure there are many in this world who believe the gods are distant and uncaring..."""
1171,Graehamkracker,"Bendron speaks first in a hushed voice, intending to speak to Demryon and Chad without Gideon hearing: ""Not uncaring, exactly, but above. Their designs are more complex than we can know, and I'm sure that there's compassion in them."""
1172,Dragodar,"Listen Check: (1d20+2)16You barely manage to hear Bendron's words to the rest of the group, despite their quietness. Whether you indicate that you heard them is up to you."
1173,Nightwing32193,"""Tell that to the charred remains of my baby sister, dwarf. I'm sure she'll agree."""
1174,Graehamkracker,"""She's not the one who needs to hear it. Your suffering is not devoid of purpose, and your tragedies are still horrid. But blaming the gods for not acting in your favor is fruitless, and hating them for allowing others to do evil is poisioning."""
1175,Nightwing32193,"Gideon knows Bendron is right. He's just too stubborn to admit it. He's seen some shït. He's almost died on multiple occasions. Having someone to blame this entire time is what's kept his rage fueled battle strength in tact. To let that go means to change who he is entirely. To let go of all that anger is to change his identity at this point. Gideon (int 12) is aware of this. But being the stubborn âsshat that he is. He doesn't acknowledge any one. Or anything besides his own anger, and let's be honest, fear of losing who he's become.Gideon lies down and doesn't answer."
1176,RealZachKraus,"Chadwick sits crisscross applesauce next to Gideon. ""Despair won't bring her back bud. Just like it won't reconcile me with my love, or bring me home.

1177,Graehamkracker,"Having said his piece, Bendron lies down looking at the sky"
1178,Nightwing32193,"Gideon sits up, ""Why in the world do you only where one armoured glove?! I just noticed when u punched me in the nose."""

1180,Nightwing32193,"Gideon shakes his head and scooches  closer, ""You were saying?"" "
1181,RealZachKraus,"Chadwick looks down at his unarmored left hand. ""To you, at least.."""
1182,Nightwing32193,"""Long story short, I might be betrothed to cleric of Eloh...."" his voice trails off as he mumbles the last few syllables."
1183,RealZachKraus,"Chadwick, caught mid-sip, starts coughing and sputtering. After a fee awkward moments, he catches his breath. ""Sorry, might be?"""
1184,Nightwing32193,"The barbarian' s tone softens, ""She saved my life. One thing led to another and now I wear her necklace. Funny old world innit?"""
1185,Dragodar,"Demryon peers at the necklace with interest. ""Ahh, our Moedri cousins revere Ehlonna. A quaint religion, but in my opinion too preoccupied with things of this world. Ehlonna has little need for philosophy or contemplation of ideals. The law of nature is more concerned with the empirical than the metaphysical, and the goddess of fertility is more interested in the carnal than the spiritual."""
1186,RealZachKraus,"Chadwick screws his face up, ignoring the elf, ""She know where you are?"""
1187,Nightwing32193,"Gideon also ignores the elf and smiles, ""I've kept it to myself, haven't told anyone. And to answer your questions...no."" his tone hardens with the last sentance."
1188,Dragodar,"""What about you, Ben? Any long lost lovers you've not told us about?"" Demryon asks with a smile. He pauses, as though suddenly realizing the implication of his question, and adds in a more tactful tone: ""Matter of fact, I've never asked you about it before, but... I imagine it's rather lonely waking up after your long nap and, well... not knowing anybody. Wanna talk about it?"""
1189,RealZachKraus,"Chadwicks tone softens inversely to Gideon's, ""She know what happened to your family?"""
1190,Graehamkracker,"After a moment, Bendron stirs. ""I am not yet sure if I'm lonely or not. I did anticipate this happening, but it is still far from the ideal circumstances for <i>endurbyggja"""
1191,Dragodar,"""Wait, what happened to your family?"" Demnryon asks Gideon. Turning back to Bendron, ""<i>Endurbyggja? I never did well in my studies of the Thandi tongue, and I'm not sure how much crossover there is with Yundri so I don't know that it would help me much anyway."""
1192,Graehamkracker,"""Probably closest to <i>rebuilding or <i> resurgence."""

1194,Dragodar,"The group beds down and sleeps soundly through the night, taking shifts at watch. The next day, they rise early, well rested and eager to begin.It is 6:00 AM on Friday, Iru 12th."
1195,Graehamkracker,Bendron wakes up and starts the morning with some stretching before running his halberd through a series of maneuvers.
1196,Nightwing32193,"Gideon is snoring. Not loudly and obnoxiously, but loud enough it's slightly endearing."
1197,Dragodar,"When the party awakes, Uamm is already up and meticulously polishing his sword with a clean white rag. The blade glints in the morning sun as he carefully inspects it.It is still early enough that the morning dew clings to grass, clothes, and packs. A cool breeze flutters across the plain as birds chirp merrily in the distance. The now foreboding sight of Farindahl looms on the horizon, tiny in the distance.""Good morning,"" Uamm says, noticing the group as they rise. ""How did you sleep?"""
1198,Nightwing32193,"Gideon opens one eye wearily, ""Don't you non humans need sleep or whatever?"" he mumbles, almost incoherently."
1199,Dragodar,"Demryon laughs. ""I'll let you in on a secret... we do sleep. We just keep it secret to keep up appearances. Shh!""Uamm smiles and mutters under his breath, ""Yeah, Demryon sleeps because he's a búsaoire, but that doesn't go for all of us...""""What?"" Demryon snaps.""No, nothing,"" Uamm responds with a start. He finds an invisible smudge on his blade and concentrates very hard on it as he polishes vigorously with his rag."

Demryon and Gideon hide in the bushesThe cart was full of mercenaries - Demryon sighted them and went to alert Gideon, and Chad failed to negotiate with the driver. Eventually Bendron signals the attack, and arrow slay one of the mercenariesAfter a few misses and minor hits, Uamm decapitates one of the mercenaries3 rush at the archers, and one meets an arrow from DemryonThe others rush to the front of the cart at Uamm, but fail to land a blow.Gideon drops his bow and pulls out the greatsword, cleaving one of his foes in half.Bendron takes another hit, then upends a mercenary and smashes his face with the halberd as he lands on the ground.Uamm stabs two mercenaries in a stacatto and they both fallThe two who charged the ambushers miss Demryon but hit Gideon in the side. Gideon returns the favor by killing him. Demryon drops the other with a third arrowChadwick slays another mercenary, and Bendron clips the other as he runs to the north. Bendron catches up the cart and jumps inside, then tells the driver it would be better to stop. He complies.Uamm and Chad chase the fleeing man, who falls to a far flying arrow from Demryon. Chad cheers.Chad squeezes the driver's thigh and tries to sweet talk him to get some information.The orcs and driver's people were enemies, but now allies of necessity due to the 'Great Blight' in thier homeland.Blight began a couple years ago, with a year of plenty. Women bore children much faster. Growth continued to speed up, as plants took over the land and resources; things grew and aged quickly, plagues of verminDead rose from graves, etcMan claims that they had to take the city to survive - this upsets Bendron, who throws him from the cart. Gideon laughs uncontrollably. ""Taking is not just surviving."" Man runs off south.The party decides to disguise themselves with the mercenaries' garb after laying them to rest. Chad takes the reigns, and drives the party to the city.Nearing the gates (5/6 pm) Chad sees a checkpoint manned by several orcs (nearly a dozen) with plenty more in the streets. There are a few other mercenaries inside the city.An orc reaches to Chad and asks for papers - a quick search by the back of the cart produces some paper and hands them to Chad. The orc is satisfied, and routinely looks into the back of the cart before waving the cart on.The party makes their way into the town, eventually hunkering down in the deserted shantytowns.The plan going forward: Demryon lets his friends know that we're making a break in two days, and to be ready for a firebombing of the tavern district.The party will then try to sneak some of the northern workers into the wagon, and take them to help free those at the southern camp.Demryon NEEDS TO GET NUMBERS OF PEOPLE"

1207,Graehamkracker,"""How guarded were those stashes?"""
1208,Dragodar,"""The garrisons are about as heavily guarded as it gets. The guard towers are better, but still not great. The university buildings could go either way.

1210,Dragodar,"As the group converses about strategy, the sounds of voices and footsteps echo up from the street below. The party is on the second floor of an abandoned three story tenement building. The wood floors are old and creaky, and there is no glass in most of the windows. A few of the rooms contain broken or worn down furniture but the building is mostly empty. There is one main staircase that connects all three floors with a roomy spiral design.The party is currently in a room at the end of the hall on the second floor. For now, the sounds on the street do not seem to be entering the building."

1212,Dragodar,"Chad's Hide Check: (1d20-2)6Chad's Spot Check:(1d20-1)13Chadwick clambers over to the window and sticks his head out. Despite his lack of sneakiness, the figures on the street are not looking around and do not see him. Below him, five orcs amble leisurely down the road, chatting with one another in orcish. All five are males -- teenagers or young adults -- and they laugh and snarl as they converse rowdily. They do not carry weapons and are not wearing armor, and appear to be relatively harmless. They continue another fifty or sixty feet down the road and then pause, still speaking with each other. A few of them start picking up rocks and throwing them at the building next to the one in which the party hides. The stones intermittently clatter off the wooden walls for a few moments, and then there is a crash as one of them shatters a window. A small cheer arises from a couple of the orcs as they continue to chat aimlessly. After several moments they continue down the road, turning a corner and passing out of sight and out of earshot."

1222,Dragodar,"""Umm... Can you rephrase the question...?"" Demryon asks, slightly confused."
1223,Nightwing32193,"Gideon sits a moment before clarifying, ""Whenever we'd conquer another tribe on the southern peninsula and add them to the Ul Vadr Kingdom, I always assumed that they were happy to be taken into our fold.

1233,Dragodar,"Demryon nods, and looks at the floor, deep in thought.Uamm quietly chimes in from his post at the window, still looking down at the street below. ""I've seen humans do terrible things, my friend. Things that your god would surely condemn with prejudice. Are they animals as well?"""
1234,Nightwing32193,"""I wish I could disagree with you. Battle pushes men to do some truly barbaric things."" Gideon says, looking at Chad, as if awaiting a response that he couldn't quite piece together himself."
1235,RealZachKraus,"Chadwick rolls his eyes, ""Sure bud, we all fall, but that's the difference, isn't it? We can recognize it."""
1236,Dragodar,"""So are the Muors evil because of their actions, or because they are orcs?"" Uamm asks."

1238,Dragodar,"""Not worth thinking about? So their women and children are worth killing because this question is  not worth thinking about?"" Uamm stares incredulously at the paladin, ignoring the street completely as he stares, slack jawed, at the armored knight, as though seeing him for a first time. A look of revulsion and horror slowly creeps over his features.""I am almost afraid to ask this, but... Have you killed orc women and children before?"""
1239,RealZachKraus,"Chadwick answers immediately, ""I haven't. They weren't 'colonizing' back then."""
1240,Dragodar,"""But you wouldn't hesitate to do it now that they are?"" Demryon asks. Uamm closes his eyes and breathes a sigh of relief at Chadwick's answer and goes back to watching the street."
1241,RealZachKraus,"Chadwick sets his jaw. ""And you guys,"" he adds offhand, his expression softening."
1242,Dragodar,"Uamm turns to Chad, a kinder look on his face. ""You have a noble heart, Chadwick, and I am honored to be included in your pledge of protection. But I do not foresee a situation in which killing innocents will be necessary to protect us."" he says gently, smiling at the paladin sympathetically.Demryon silently nods in agreement."
1243,Nightwing32193,"Gideon shoots Chadwick a quizzical, slightly confused look. Bordering on concern."
1244,Graehamkracker,"After sitting back and observing for a while, Bendron poses a question: ""Are these foreign orcs any different than the orcs on this continent?"""
1245,Dragodar,"Uamm responds to Bendron. ""Orcs have not been native to Aezelon since I was a very young boy. Several centuries ago, the last of them were forced to sail north, when humans conquered Hynnica and drove them out."""
1246,Graehamkracker,"""Fine then - are these foreign orcs any different than the orcs that used to be on this continent?"""
1247,RealZachKraus,"Chadwick swears under his breath, ""'Forced out,' fückin bleeding heart over here."""
1248,Nightwing32193,"Gideon remains silent, listening to the conversation unfold."
1249,Dragodar,"""How would you have worded it?"" Demryon asks Chadwick.Uamm addresses Bendron. ""The Muors are radically different from the previous Agorish orcs of Aezelon. The Agors were a primitive people with shamanic traditions, devoted mainly to Taperia and Noregan, though some tribes worshiped Ehlonna or Katas Jarístys. They lived in very small clans and did not build great cities or edifices. They were an undeveloped civilization, if you could even call them a civilization, who depended more on hunting and gathering than on agriculture.""The old elf stops and takes a swig from his canteen. ""The Muors are far more advanced. They have constructed sprawling cities across the continent of Nodomar, and are very scientifically advanced, perhaps moreso than many kingdoms of Aezelon. They have -- or had at one point, if we are to believe this story about the blight -- massive and complex farmlands with advanced irrigation systems and harvesting methods.""Uamm pauses to think for a moment and stares out the window. ""The Muors' religion may actually be the most interesting thing about them. They worship both Metsa Vitôra and Katas Jarístys, holding Vitôra's patronage of dark magic and Jarístys' patronage of the moon to be the highest forces in nature and the noblest pursuits of the enlightened. I don't really understand the actual tenets of their religion; they claim to want peace but proclaim that peace can only be achieved by wiping out all non believers by the sword.""""But still, I think it wrong to judge the individual based solely on the people from whence they hail, especially women and children..."""
1250,RealZachKraus,"""Look bud, you want our help or not?"""
1251,Dragodar,"Demryon raises his eyebrows. ""Only asking a question. You don't have to answer if you don't want to. Of course I want your help."""
1252,RealZachKraus,"""Let's focus then. Umam, how the streets look?"""
1253,Dragodar,"""Empty,"" Uamm responds, still standing with his back to the wall beside the window and peeking out cautiously. ""Quiet."""
1254,Nightwing32193,"""If this all goes according to plan, it'll be easy in, easy out. There won't even be any civilians to deal with. So we shouldn't worry."""
1255,Graehamkracker,"""Nothing left to do than to hunker down and wait for our window to move."" Bendron says, running a hand along the head of his halberd before returning it to it's place on his back."
1256,Dragodar,"Soon, the purple of sunset is replaced by the deep blue of dusk, which quickly fades into the milky black of night. As the stars of the southern sky twinkle overhead, the military-run city falls silent. The distant buzz of the cicadas can still be heard from the plains, but little noise arises from the city itself. The natural rowdiness of carousing orcs seems uncharacteristically absent, likely due to the strict martial governance of the city.Every half hour or so, a pair of orc soldiers pass along the street below, conducting a cursory patrol. Beyond this, the shantytown neighborhood remains devoid of activity.It is about 10:00 PM on Friday, Iru 12th."

1263,Nightwing32193,"Gideon laughs, but not as loudly as he'd like, and nods, ""Right you are."""
1264,Graehamkracker,"""Do we know of any targets we could hit today? Any gates that seem less guarded?"""
1265,Dragodar,"A few nominal guards to turn away sneak thieves and petty crooks, but nothing suited to prevent a raid. The crops are a similar story, though they are precariously close to the garrisons, which are outfitted to withstand armageddon. Most residential areas see little to no real military presence either. Any of those may be good starting points. But the garrisons, the barracks, the guard towers, the arms and munition stores, and the officer residences are all tightly patrolled."
1266,Nightwing32193,"""Sounds like everything that doesn't need protecting is heavily protected. And everything that needs protecting is, well, unprotected. Gotta love the Orcish way of thinking."""
1267,RealZachKraus,"Chadwick sighs, ""You mean all the things we need to hit, are protected..."""
1268,Dragodar,"Keep in mind were only in the city because of a particularly lazy gatekeeper. They probably do not expect to need protection for crops and foodstuffs. We are within city walls, Uamm adds, in response to Gideon."
1269,Graehamkracker,"'We could start with the stockpiles or crops, and then hit whatever gatehouse seems softest when their focus shifts. Do you elves think you could put together a paper trail to make them believe that an army is planning an attack from the south?"""
1270,Dragodar,"Uamm smiles. ""That sort of thing is your specialty, isn't it, Lord Demryon?""Demryon frowns slightly, deep in thought, as he absently strokes his chin. ""Yes, I think we can handle it,"" he responds after a few moments.(1d20-1)11(1d20-1)8(1d20+2)16With a violent start, you are alarmed to see a massive horned owl sitting on the window sill. You did not hear it approach or land in the slightest.Demryon and Uamm sit down on the floor next to one another and begin to converse in low murmurs."
1271,Nightwing32193,"Gideon stares at it for a second before speaking, ""It's not spying on us is it?"""
1272,Dragodar,"Demryon spins around rapidly, a wide grin forming on his face. ULHARC! Youre back! He exclaims, beaming.The ranger leaps to his feet and crosses the room in a single bound, reaching out his hand. The massive bird hops nimbly onto his wrist. It is over two feet tall and its feathers are  a patchwork of dark brown and white. Demryon gently strokes its head as it nuzzles his hand affectionately."
1273,Nightwing32193,"Gideon shakes his head in amazement, ""That's awesome."" he says quietly."
1274,Dragodar,"Gents, meet my most loyal companion, Ulharc. Anyone who says dog is mans best friend has never owned a great horned owl, Demryon says with a chuckle.The elf reaches into his pocket and retrieves a small tidbit of some sort, which he offers to the owl, who snaps it up gratefully. After swallowing the treat, the giant bird looks Demryon in the eyes unblinkingly and holds its left leg out to him, displaying impressive balance as it stands on its right with its wings outspread.Ah, whats this? Demryon says. With the owl still perched on his left arm, Demryon uses his right hand to untie the small roll of parchment tied to the birds outstretched leg.The elf makes a short kissing noise with his lips and the owl hops dutifully off his arm, gliding silently to the floor. As Demryon unrolls the small piece of parchment, Ulharc hops around the room, poking his beak around and investigating his new environment.It seems our Moedri friends have finally responded to our call for aid.As Demryon reads the note, his smile fades into a frown of consternation. He slowly begins to read it out loud.""Lord Demryon,We have received word of your plight and our Council has deliberated thoroughly on the matter. After having lost so many Moedri warriors to the Muorish campaign in Audaria, many of our Elders were loath to send more of our young men to their deaths. However, because of the gravity of the situation, and the severity with which it will affect all the peoples of Aezelon if left unchecked, we are prepared to dispatch a body of 2000 Moedri warriors, including 1000 infantry, 500 cavalry, 300 archers, and 200 pikemen. The files are being led by Consul Neurinn and Praetors Aywim and Soriss.I say ""prepared to"" because it is conditional on the kingdom of Lorn sending an equal number. Because of your estimate of 5000 Muorish swords within the city of Farindahl, we are unable to assume the risk of being so severely outnumbered and therefore cannot dispatch our soldiers until we receive word in good faith that Lorn has done the same.We  are currently in discussion with Lorn regarding the dispatch of these reinforcements. We wish you and your people the best of fortune. Stay strong, hold out. Help will soon be on the way.With the sincerest of regards, Marwyn Hiufether, First Elder of the Moedri Council and High Seat of the Sylvanel Laurels"""
1275,Graehamkracker,"""Well, no need to change our plans then. What do we want to hit today?"""
1276,RealZachKraus,"Chadwick shrugs, ""Well we should probably continue with our plan. I don't foresee Lorn sending reinforcements to a war they don't believe exists."""
1277,Graehamkracker,"""Why don't we go scope out some targets and some other hiding spots, then figure out what we want to do?"""
1278,Dragodar,"As the party plans their move, a sprinkling of rain begins to fall outside. Only a few drops at first, it soon becomes a steady drizzle. The muffled whisper of the shower dampens all other noise and imparts an insular feeling to the lonely upstairs chamber in the desolate shantytown of the city.The five companions huddle together as they discuss their course of action. The small, empty room feels like a comfortable little pocket of safety within the hostile city, a mouse's tunnel tucked away in an abandoned corner of a house full of hungry cats.The rainclouds in the sky completely block the moon and stars, making it entirely dark inside the room. The adventurers are not even able to see each other's faces. The only sounds are the rainfall, the hushed whispers of the group, and the soft clicking of Ulharc's talons as he hops around the wooden floor looking for insects.It is midnight between Friday, Iru 12th and Saturday, Iru 13th."
1279,Nightwing32193,"""What do you think? Should we start causing mayhem first? Or do we assess more targets?"""
1280,Graehamkracker,"""May as well make some use of this lovely weather - the darnkess and rain should hide our mischief until the morning."""
1281,Nightwing32193,"""Yeah I agree, travel light I would assume. No sense in carrying that entire entire ax on a pole around while we're trying to be sneaky."""
1282,Graehamkracker,"""Might as well just leave the bumbling brute at home too."""
1283,Nightwing32193,"Gideon looks over at Chad and grins, ""I couldn't agree more Ben."""
1284,RealZachKraus,"Chad chuckles, ""Alright fine, I'll stick behind. Thought we passed a bar on the way in..."""
1285,Dragodar,"As the companions bandy words in preparation for their forray, a muted sound can be heard from the street below and the faint glow of a torch can be seen through the window. Uamm tip toes to the window and peers out. ""Orcs,"" he whispers quietly.Looking out the window, the party can see a troop of about half a dozen orcs in the street below. Half of them are holding torches, and all of them are armed to the teeth. The squad seems to be going from door to door, entering and searching the empty buildings on the street. Their modus operandi appears to be to have four orcs enter the buildings, leaving two outside to keep guard.They are still a few doors down, and each building takes them several minutes.It is just after midnight, early in the morning of Saturday, Iru 13th."
1286,Nightwing32193,"Gideon looks around at his companions,""Fight or flight boys? No time like the present to cause some disruption."""
1287,BeefyChickens,"""Seems the opportunity has presented itself. This is where the fun begins."" Demryon says, hushed, as he pulls his bows string to his cheek."
1288,RealZachKraus,"Chadwick winks at Gideon ""Whatta you think?"""
1289,Nightwing32193,"Gideon readies his short sword and dagger, ""We doin' this hush hush? Or do we want to make a scene?"""
1290,RealZachKraus,"Chadwick hits him the low bones. ""Let's get our d!cks down there and hit em."""
1291,Nightwing32193,"Gideon looks around the room at the rest of them, ""Sounds like a fûcking plan to me."" with that, he moves quietly down to the floor below and hides himself as best he can among the abandoned shack, armed with his short sword and dagger."
1292,Dragodar,"The orcs exit the building across the street and make their way to the building immediately adjacent to the one which the companions are occupying. Within minutes, they will be at your doorstep."
1293,RealZachKraus,"Chadwick points at the group, and then at the stairwell. Without saying anything (because the time for words has long past) he starts heading down the stairs, two at a time. He makes it down the stairs and posts up on the opposite side of the groud floor door from Gideon. Unable to contain his his excitement, he lets out a quiet giggle."
1294,Dragodar,"As Chadwick moves down the stairs, Bendron and Gideon follow him and post up next to the door once they reach the first floor. Uamm and Demryon bring up the rear, staying silent as they creep toward the entrance of the building.The party can hear the remaining orcs outside speaking to one another in Orcish. They seem as yet unaware of the party's presence within the building."
1295,Nightwing32193,"Gideon looks at his brother, born of battle. A slight smile crosses his face as he sees Chad's excitement,""Send em home."" he whispers, with an outstretched fist."
1296,RealZachKraus,"Chadwick's grin somehow adds a tinge of extra light to the darkened hallway, ""The lord'll sort 'em."" He lowers his unarmored left fist down to the level of his waist, lightly dusting Gideon's outstretched fist without even looking."
1297,Dragodar,"As the party waits in the shadows with bated breath, the two orc lookouts continue conversing outside while their companions inspect the building next door. ""They're doing a routine check,"" Uamm whispers. ""I heard something about 'the captain making us do such a useless job even though it's the middle of the night and raining' or something like that."""
1298,Graehamkracker,"Bendron loosens his halberd, readying it for the opening door. He whispers back: ""Doesn't matter. End them, leave a false trail, and find somewhere else to hit tonight before we hide elsewhere."""
1299,Nightwing32193,"Gideon nods, but stays silent, focusing on the impending battle."
1300,Dragodar,"The group waits, weapons drawn, for the orcs to enter. The sound of several orcs joining the conversation outside can be heard as the four investigators exit the building next door. The discussion continues for but a moment before the handle of the door jiggles and turns. There is a moment of silence as everyone holds their breath.The door swings open and four burly orcs in full armor come into view. Two of them are holding torches; all of them have their weapons drawn. As the first orc to enter looks up and sees the waiting warriors, a look of surprise crosses his face. His surprised expression quickly turns to an angry scowl, but before he can shout a warning to his companions, the waiting party acts.Take your actions as you please."
1301,RealZachKraus,Chadwick yells out an extremely offensive phrase as he swings his great axe at the lead orc's neck.he rolls a DAMN 17 if that doesn't cut the mf's head off then I quit

1303,BeefyChickens,"Demryon releases his fingers from the bows the string, unleashing a deadly strike."
1304,Graehamkracker,"As the others attack, Bendron sets his feet and charges through the doorway, barrelling into the first orc still on their feet.Stance = punishing, -2ac +1d6 dmgCharging minoraur: Bull Rush (Str Check): (1d20+8)21Damage if successful: (3d6+4)14Will knock back 5 ft, can do 5 more for each 5 my street check &gt; theirs."

The cry of warning on his lips falters as Gideon shortsword pierces his neck, drawing a satisfying spurt of warm blood from his jugular. Demryon's arrow barely misses and whistles away into the night. The first orc in line gurgles and falls to his knees, clapping a hand to his neck and collapsing onto the ground. The sound of his choking and sputtering continues as the other orcs let out cries of anger and press forward. He is incapacitated but somehow still clinging to life.As the remaining orcs move into the gap created by the feeling of their comrade, Bendron charges forward and with a mighty shove, knocks the front orc back into his companions. As the dwarf slams into the lead orc, he smashes the unfortunate soldier in the jaw. A loud crunch can be heard as the orc likely bites his own tongue clean off. He lets out a wail of agony and stumbles backward, tripping over his fallen companion and falling into the orcs behind him as he spits blood everywhere.Chadwick: (1d20+2)11Gideon: (1d20+3)19Demryon: (1d20+9)23Bendron: (1d20+2)8Uamm: (1d20+7)14Orc1: (1d20+3)17Orc2: (1d20+3)7Orc3: (1d20+3)12Orc4: (1d20+3)16Orc5: (1d20+3)5"

1307,BeefyChickens,Demryon quickly notches two arrows. He fires both almost simultaneously at the nearest of their burly foes.Attack: roll0Damage: roll1
1308,Dragodar,"Demryon, staying stationary, releases two arrows in quick succession at the nearest orc, taking advantage of his position and the orcs' confusion to release a deadly barrage into their midst.<i>+9 RAB+1 magicAttack 1: (1d20+10)27 (CRIT)<i>Rampage Brawler +1d6Damage 1: (3d8+3)17 (1d6)4<i>+9 RAB+1 magicAttack 1: (1d20+10)16 Damage 1: (1d8+1)6The first arrow sails through the air and embeds itself neatly in the eye of one of the orcs behind the one who was knocked prone by Bendron, dropping him immediately and silently to the ground. The second arrow strikes the final orc in the chest and he cries out in pain.At this point, anyone near the door can see that the two lookout orcs have taken off and are sprinting down the street. They are already nearly fifty feet away, heading toward the heart of the city.<u>Round 1<strike>Orc6</strike></li></ul>"
1309,Nightwing32193,"Gideon silently curses, but focuses on the task at hand. Taking advantage of the confusion, he grabs the nearest orc, puts him in a headlock and slits his throat.(1d20+8)16Damage: (1d6+4)8Attack: roll1d20+8/rollDamage: roll1d4+4/roll"
1310,Dragodar,"Gideon manages to grab the last orc standing and drag his blade across his neck, killing him instantly. Three dead orcs and one piteous, gurgling orc lie in the doorway. The lookouts are currently running down the street and shouting loudly.Uamm, standing in the back and so far inert, calls out, ""Better catch them before we're found out!""<u>Round 1<strike>Orc6</strike></li></ul>"
1311,RealZachKraus,"Chadwick takes off running after the two lookout orcs. He screams behind him, ""They're gonna alert the city, you cöcks! Let's go boys.."""
1312,Dragodar,"The orcs have just enough of a headstart that Chadwick trails a few steps behind them. It's raining much harder now, and the steady roar of the downpour mostly drowns out their shouts. Soon, however, they will alert the city."
1313,Nightwing32193,Gideon overtakes the second with relative ease and executes a picture perfect form tackle that leaves the orc gasping for air. Gideon gets up on one knee and snaps the orc' s neck with his hands.
1314,Dragodar,"Gideon's long strides quickly carry him past Chadwick and he is soon able to catch up with the fleeing orcs. Throwing himself into one of them, he tackles the runner to the ground.

1315,RealZachKraus,Chadwick continues running.
1316,Nightwing32193,"After feeling the neck of the first orc snap, Gideon leaps to his feet and sprints after the next one in an attempt to bring him down as well before he makes it to people that can hear."
1317,Dragodar,"<i>FORT saves to avoid tiringChadwick: (1d20+10)24Orc: (1d20+2)17The second orc begins to slow as he runs out of breath, but Chadwick pursues relentlessly, his arms pumping in perfect time as his regular breath keeps the beat. Within seconds, Chadwick is upon his quarry, only inches away. Gideon is bringing up the rear and gaining fast."
1318,RealZachKraus,"As Chadwick approaches the orc, he pulls off his armored glove and throws it his quarry."
1319,Graehamkracker,"Back by the fallen orcs, Bendron gives them a quick inspection to see if he can learn anything or find anything of value. Addressing the elves: ""We need to leave a false trail and move on to hit something else."""
1320,Dragodar,"Chadwick hurls his heavy steel gauntlet at the orc in front of him.Attack: (1d20+6)15<i>improvised weaponDamage: (1d4)3The gauntlet strikes the orc in the back of the head and he grunts in pain but continues to run. It slows the orc down enough that Chadwick is literally alongside him at this point, still running. The orc does a double take, looking at Chad with a mixture of fear and confusion. Gideon is close behind them. Less than a hundred feet ahead of them, they can see one of the fifteen foot stone walls that separate the district. It looms every closer, and as they remember from their entrance into this district, just around the turn in the road ahead is a gate which is sure to be guarded.X: the orc's presumed destination, the gate to the garrison wardY: your current location (and the orc's)Z: Uamm, Demryon, Bendron, and the dead orcs=============Meanwhile, Bendron rifles through the pockets of the three dead orcs as the one living orc continues to gurgle and weep while he chokes on his own blood. Altogether, between the three corpses, Bendron finds: 20 gold coins, 1 shortsword, 2 daggers, 1 longsword, 2 twenty-foot coils of hemp rope, 1 crudely drawn map of Farindahl, 6 feet of thin twine, 1 small linen pouch containing a handful of dead and dried frogs, 2 rusty pairs of manacles, 1 small key ring with two keys on it, 1 set of gaming dice carved out of wood, 5 scraps of paper with Orcish writing on them, 3 wooden smoking pipes, 3 pouches of dried tobacco, 2 flint-and-steels, and 2 unlit torches.Uamm and Demryon nod at the dwarf's words.""Best get to work then,"" Uamm says. ""Anything we want to ask this one before we send him to meet the gods?"" he asks, gesturing at the gurgling orc."
1321,Graehamkracker,"Bendron grabs the coin, pipes, tobacco, manacles, and keys, then hands the map and paper to the elves. ""Anything useful in these?"". Now that he's noticed the surviving orc, Bendron slides the blade of his halberd across it's neck to finish him."
1322,Dragodar,"Uamm studies the notes, and a slight frown crosses his features. Bendron can't be sure what emotion it betrays, but it's something between sadness and disgust.""Merely trifles,"" Uamm mutters, handing the notes back to Bendron. ""Nothing of import.""The orc ceases his gurgling as Bendron mercifully ends his life. Rain continues to pour down violently as Gideon and Chadwick race down the street in the distance."
1323,Nightwing32193,"Gideon lunges at the fleeing orc, attempting to bring him down."
1324,Dragodar,"<sup>1Gideon once again crashes into his quarry, but the orc skillfully slams his elbow into Gideon's temple as they come into contact.<sup>2They both go to the ground and the orc thrashes wildly as he struggles to free himself.<sup>3The orc slashes across Gideon's ribs with a dagger, drawing blood. As he does, he screams out in Orcish ""AZH URAH NAGZ IBIZHUR! AZH IBIZHUR!""<sup>4The orc manages to wriggle free from Gideon's grasp and stands up to continue running. Chadwick, however, is standing right next to the struggling pair.Chadwick gets an AoO if you want it.As the orc stands, the sound of a bell rings out. From somewhere within the garrison district, an alarm is sounding.

1325,RealZachKraus,"Chadwick brings his axe straight down into the back of the orc attempting to right himself screaming, ""OH FOR FÜCKS SAKE"""
1326,Nightwing32193,Gideon looks around after hearing the alarm.
1327,Dragodar,"Chadwick's blow instantly silences the orc and drops him to the ground. The orc lies inert, face down in a growing pool of his own blood. As far as any of you are able to see, the street is still empty, but the alarm bell is still ringing and you likely have less than a minute until backup arrives.Remember, the gate is barely a hundred feet away, just around a bend in the road. They have not seen you yet but there will likely be guards coming around the bend VERY soon."
1328,Nightwing32193,"""As much as I'd like to relive old times with you, let's get the fûck outta here."" Says Gideon as he turns around and sprints back to the original shanty."
1329,RealZachKraus,"Chadwick spits, ""Time to roll, boys."""
1330,BeefyChickens,"Demryon collects any arrows he can find loosed from his bow. Tugging at the arrow implanted in one of the unfortunate orcs eye sockets with slight strain he grunts ""Just in case the brutes remember my shot.""Demryon goes to one knee and jams his knife in that same cavity and gives a slight twist, concealing any indication of the precision strike made earlier. Then striding over the next corpse, and with that much more effort removes the arrow from the others chest."
1331,Graehamkracker,"""Finally. Any idea where we're going?"""
1332,Nightwing32193,"Gideon slides across the wet pavement and lands perfectly in the doorway, his large, soaking wet frame fills the entrance as blood seeps through his shirt, ""We gotta get outta here boys. Dem, where should we shove off to?"" then without another word sprints up the stairs. He comes down presently with his great sword slung across his shoulder."
1333,Dragodar,"Chadwick snatches up the torch that the orc was holding and follows Gideon. Sprinting back at top speed, Chadwick and Gideon come to a halt near the dwarf and the elves. The rain is coming down torrentially now, and every few moments a brilliant flash of lightning illuminates the dark road, followed almost immediately by deafening cracks of thunder.The only sources of light on the darkened street apart from the lightning are the two torches previously carried by the lookout orcs. One of these is held by Chadwick, and the other lies on the wet cobblestones of the street, spitting and sputtering as the pitch struggles to burn despite the shallow puddle it's in."
1334,Graehamkracker,"""Toss the torches in the building - if it lights that could buy us some time. Then we need to move - no one else can see in this mire either, so it should be easy to see their torches. Do we do this whole prison break tonight, or find somewhere else to lay low?"" Bendron picks up the torch from the ground and steps inside to find something to light as he finishes."
1335,Nightwing32193,"""If you want, me and Chad could run some more distractions for you. That way you may have an easier time breaking in. Since the alarm bells already tolling, why not?"""
1336,BeefyChickens,"""I think our best bet would be to snake through to the marketplace via the north side of the caravan district."""
1337,RealZachKraus,"""We might be able to take advantage of this ballyhoo. Security may be focused on a manhunt and may leave an opening for us to hit?"""
1338,Dragodar,"Bendron enters the building with the torch. In one of the rooms off of the main hallway, he finds a few broken wooden chairs and an old wooden table. He quickly moves them together into a pile at the center of the room and tosses the torch into the mess of furniture.Outside, the glow of torches appears around the bend up the street. The orcs are mere seconds away."
1339,Graehamkracker,"Bendron emerges and starts off to the right, and stops. ""Wait. Which way's north?"""
1340,Nightwing32193,"""Throw the damn miss on and let's fûckin' go!"" "
1341,Dragodar,"Uamm calls to Bendron through the roar of the pouring rain, as the dwarf starts to run toward the glow of the torches. ""North is the way you're going but I don't think we should make it that easy for them.""With that, he takes off in the opposite direction, heading south down the dark street. ""Caravan district is this way. Come on!"""
1342,Graehamkracker,""" I thought we wanted to go north....."" Bendron tails off as he sighs and starts to run after the elves, halberd held close to his chest."
1343,BeefyChickens,"""No use in starin lads, lets be off."" Demryon tails Uamm towards the caravan district."
1344,Dragodar,"The gang rapidly makes their way south down the street, turning left down the an avenue that leads east. As they turn, they see the light of several torches at the north end of the street, about three hundred feet behind them. Moving quickly, they scurry through the darkness as the rain slaps at their backs. About two hundred feet after their initial turn, they pass a street that cuts off heading north, parallel to the street they've just escaped. Directly ahead of them and about a hundred feet away, the gate to the caravan district appears to be unguarded but closed.As the party rounds the corner at point <i>Y, they catch a glimpse of several torches rounding the bend at point <i>X. The gate to the caravan district lies ahead, at point <i>Z.LINK"
1345,Dragodar,"A few more moments, and they are at the gate. It is indeed unguarded but closed. The faint glow of orc torches can be seen around the corner a few hundred feet behind them, and their muffled shouts can be heard despite the thunder and rain."
1346,Nightwing32193,Gideon looks around for away around or over the gate.
1347,Dragodar,"The district walls are almost fifteen feet tall and less than two feet thick, made of stone and mortar. A thin walkway of wooden boards runs along the top, but there is no parapet on the district walls like there is on the outer walls of the city. The gate itself is wooden double doors, about twelve feet tall and ten feet across, and barred with a long timber beam. There is no lock or mechanism holding the beam in its crooks.Working together, they quickly lift the beam out of the catches, but the door still will not open. Uamm sighs in exasperation. ""Damn. Farindahl gates have crossbar hooks on both sides; they must have barred the other side as well."""
1348,Nightwing32193,"""Might as well try."" He takes as firm a hold as the wet surface will allow and begins to scale the wall."
1349,Graehamkracker,"Bendron offers his hands as a platform, but is too late. He insead works to pull the rope out of his pack."
1350,Dragodar,"After replacing the beam in the hooks, the party searches for other means of passing this new obstacle.Gideon sizes up the wall for climbing, but realizes before even attempting that it would be fruitless. The walls are smooth and offer no handholds. The walls are also set far enough from the buildings that climbing a nearby building and jumping across is out of the question.After some brief rummaging, Bendron manages to extract his rope from his pack."
1351,BeefyChickens,"Demryon, remembering the rope arrows in his pack, exclaims ""Hold on gentleman, Ive got just the thing."" as he reaches into his pack producing the rope and arrow combo. Notching the arrow he aims where it it would rest most stable."

1354,Dragodar,"The wall is stone all the way to the top, but when Demryon steps about twenty feet back from the wall, his new vantage point allows him to aim at a tall building on the other side of the wall. He knocks the thick anchor arrow with the rope attached, draws his bow, and waits. As soon as the next flash of lightning occurs, he aims and releases in one instantaneous motion. The arrow sails through the air, with the thin elven rope trailing behind it, and before anyone can see it strike home, the lightning ends and it is pitch black again. Despite the darkness, they hear a satisfying thud as the arrow embeds itself in the wood of the building on the other side of the wall. The rope is just long enough. The next flash of lightning reveals it to be hanging over the wall and dangling about eight feet off the ground. Demryon reaches up, grasps the rope, and tugs hard to test its security. Once he is assured of its dependability, he nimbly pulls himself up the wall, hand over hand.Moments later, another flash of lightning reveals Demryon crouching atop the wall. There is a moment of darkness before the next flash, and Demryon is gone.Knowing that time is of the essence, you slip over the wall to secure the rope. You can see the heavyduty arrow stuck deep in the wood of the building in front of you, about twenty feet up the wall, a significant climb. The rope dangles from the end of it, no longer hanging over the wall but now resting in a messy coil at your feet, directly beneath the arrow. What do you do?While you wait for your companion to secure the rope so the rest of you can climb over, you hear the shouts of the orcs behind you. Turning around, you can see the light of their torches rounding the corner. The torches allow you to see them clearly, but it is dark enough that they cannot see you. A bright enough flash of lightning, however, will reveal you to them.From what you can see, there are about a dozen orcs. Each one holds a torch, and all of them have their weapons drawn. They are decked out in matching armor, and appear well organized and disciplined. These orcs are obviously an on-duty detachment from the barracks."
1355,BeefyChickens,Demryon knots the end of the rope and wedges the rope and the newly formed monkeys fist in the walls panels.
1356,Graehamkracker,"Bendron mumbles under his breath, and sets himself at the foot of the wall. He offers his hands as a stirrup with the intention to boost an ally's foot upwards to where Demryon can catch them with the rope. <hr size=""1"" style=""color: rgb(209,209,225);""/>* post roll count doesn't match database</em>"
1357,Nightwing32193,"Gideon draws his great sword and faces the orcs but doesn't move towards them. ""We shouldn't be caught flat footed. In case they do and up seeing us. Hurry up."""
1358,BeefyChickens,"Demryon bolts over to the gate a removes the bar from the slats, then knocks on the gate."
1359,Dragodar,"Gideon takes a defensive stance, his greatsword in hand, as the rest of the party prepares to climb the rope. Before they can however, the rope slithers over the wall and disappears. A moment later, they hear a knock on the gate over the sound of the heavy rainfall. The orcs are drawing closer now, making their way down the street. They are obviously agitated at the discovery of their dead comrades but have not yet seen the party through the darkness."
1360,Graehamkracker,"""Oh. That makes more sense. "" Bendron returns to the door and pushes it open enough to slip through."
1361,Nightwing32193,Gideon makes sure the party is through the gate before following.
1362,BeefyChickens,"""Im going to rebar the other side so were not followed."" Demryon, much like before scaled the wall hand over hand and disappears. Moments later he reappears and rejoins the party."
1363,Nightwing32193,"""That elf's got balls."""
1364,Dragodar,"Demryon finds that he has much the same problem as Gideon. Without the rope, there are no handholds on the wall and he is unable to scale it. However, the gate is still open and he is able to walk through it. Closing the gate, Demryon rebars it, only to find himself on the wrong side yet again."
1365,Graehamkracker,"Bendron sighs, then tosses one end of his rope over the wall to pull Demryon over the top."
1366,Nightwing32193,"Gideon sighs and shoulders his sword, ""Wow. You have got to be kidding me right now."""
1367,Dragodar,"The powerful dwarf is easily able to haul the lightweight elf over the wall, and within moments, the party finds themselves together and in the caravan district, with the gate properly barred behind them."
1368,Nightwing32193,"""Okay. So now what?"""
1369,Graehamkracker,"""We can't stay here. Maybe find somewhere else to hunker down, and then see if we can make more mischief tonight?"""
1370,Dragodar,"With the gate finally secured shut behind them, the companions are able to take stock of their surroundings as best they can in the pitch black. During the flashes of lightning, they are able to see that the caravan district is made up almost entirely of carts, wagons, carriages, tents, stalls, and other temporary structures. The mingled aromas of road dirt, sweat, horse dung, and tanned leather meet their nostrils as they enter the mixing pot of the city. During the reign of the elves, the caravan district was the area where exotic merchants would stay while they peddled their wares in the city. Very few permanent buildings line the streets, as most of the space was typically used for temporary buildings. Now that the orcs occupy Farindahl, it seems the area is being used for much the same purpose. This ramshackle collection of wagons and carts seems to be where the foreign human allies of the Muors have taken up residence.In addition to the pungent smells of the caravan district, the party is able to discern the smell of smoke as well. The distant tolling of the alarm bell continues to chime, but it has not yet been joined by the bells of the other districts. This ward of the city is particularly dangerous for fugitives and sneaks, due to the lack of tall buildings and the proximity to the streets of tents with sleeping occupants."
1371,Nightwing32193, knowledge check about the human allies and how best to blend in with them.
1372,Dragodar,"You dont have ranks in the appropriate knowledge skill (or any knowledge skills, for that matter) so its just a raw INT check.(1d20+1)14You can surmise from the caravan you hijacked and the few humans youve seen within the city that they tend to dress in flowy, loose fitting clothes and often wear head scarves or stylized turbans. Their weapons seem to be crafted in a different style from Aezelon weapons, tending to favor smooth curves and soft bends over straight edges and hard lines."
1373,Nightwing32193,"""So do we try and blend in? Doesn't seem like many hiding spots in this district."" "
1374,Graehamkracker,"""Distance may hide us better. Let's  head north and grab the first cart or disguise we can find."""
1375,Dragodar,"The smell of smoke grows stronger, and a faint orange glow can be seen from the shantytown. The bell continues to chime out its alarm."
1376,Graehamkracker,"Seeing the nods from his companions, Bendron leads the party north towards the center of town. To the elves, he adds ""Keep an eye out for places we can hunker down"""
1377,Nightwing32193,"Gideon shrugs and wipes rainwater from his face, only for it to be immediately replaced by more, ""Fûck it. What could go wrong?"" he says to himself and follows Bendron."
1378,Dragodar,"The group makes their way between the crowded rows of tents and carts, plodding carefully down the muddy street while desperately trying to remain undetected. Before they've gone more than fifty feet, they hear the distant bell of the garrison district joined by the much closer bell of the shantytown they just left. The smell of smoke is clearly distinct now, as is the muddled orange glow of fire through the rain and the fog. In the distance, cries of alarm and vague shouting can be heard. The fire in the shantytown seems to be garnering attention.Just ahead, there is a small crossroads with a tall lamppost illuminating it. The soft yellow gleam of the lantern threatens to expose the party to any watchful eyes that may be scanning the area if they pass beneath it, but to circumvent it would require them to walk off the roads, directly amongst the tents and wagons. A dangerous dilemma stands before them, as the shantytown alarm bell tolls loudly behind them."
1379,Nightwing32193,"""Dem, you think you could take care of that light?"""
1380,Graehamkracker,"""To break the glass and put it out? I can do that."" Bendron interjects, rummaging through some pockets."
1381,Nightwing32193,"""Wait, wait. What? What are you doing?"""
1382,Graehamkracker,"""We can knock the lantern down, which should put out the light. The storm should mask any noise."" Bendron has produced a green rock about the size of his fist, and is slowly juggling it in his right hand."
1383,Graehamkracker,"Taking the lack of responses as assent, Bendron carefully aims and throws the rock, hoping any noises are drowned out by the storm.(1d20+2)18 DEX check for throw(1d20-1)17 spot check to retrieve the rock - I do have dark vision"
1384,Nightwing32193,"Gideon shrugs, ""Worth a shot I guess."""
1385,Dragodar,"With a flick of his wrist, Bendron hurls the small green rock at the lantern. It sails through the wind and rain in a beautifully smooth arc, neatly popping the weak glass pane of the cover as well as the glass of the lantern. The flame is extinguished immediately and the stone falls, landing directly underneath the lamp. The sound of the wind and the rain made the crack of the thin glass practically inaudible, so there is no unwanted reaction to the event. The stone sits mundanely in the mud underneath the now dark lamppost."
1386,Graehamkracker,"As soon as the rock hits, Bendron rushes up to retrieve it and cross the now darkened path, waving the rest to follow him."
1387,Nightwing32193,"""Well that was impressive I suppose."" Gideon follows the dwarf."
1388,Dragodar,"Passing through the now darkened intersection, the party makes their way quietly down the street. After another two hundred feet or so, they find themselves at another intersection. This one is familiar, despite the dark and the rain. It is the first intersection they passed when entering the city.The gravel road they are on continues straight through more tents, carts, and low houses; up ahead, it curves to the left and out of sight. The avenue that crosses it is nearly twice as wide and cobbled instead of gravel. To their right stands the massive gate  shut and barred  which they had previously entered through the towering walls of the city. To their left, a smaller gateway provides passage through a smaller inner wall, much like the one Demryon just opened minutes ago.This smaller gateway is the very same that they had passed through after entering the city, and they know from memory that it leads to the southern marketplace. This gate, however, is shut and barred, and from the intersection at which they stand they can see two miserable looking orcs standing on either side of it in the pouring rain. The orcs have not yet seen them."
1389,Nightwing32193,"""The city's already on alert. Why not see if they'll deploy the garrison. Be done with this before the sun rises?"""
1390,Graehamkracker,"""These two don't seem to be alert at all. Whatever we do with them, it needs to be fast and leave little trace so we can keep moving unharried. A grouping of arrows and the bodies stashed in one of these carts?"""
1391,Nightwing32193,"""Let's kill 'em. Send another message to the orcs."""
1392,Dragodar,"Spot Check: (1d20+4)19As the party quietly discusses their course of action, one of the orcs looks up and stares in their direction. He raises his torch and stares intently out into the darkness, trying to find whatever it was he heard or saw."

It strikes the burning end of his torch and sends a shower of sparks flying into his face. At the same time, Demryon's first arrow strikes the other orc in the throat, killing him instantly before he can make a sound. Half an instant later, Demryon's second arrow strikes the first orc in the chest, causing him to fall to the ground and drop his torch.The second orc, still alive but downed, begins moaning in pain. He makes a faint effort to call out for help, but the arrow in his chest seems to impede his vocal projection. He lies in the mud, struggling to make enough noise to attract attention. His coughs and groans are not loud, but certainly not inaudible."
1395,Graehamkracker,"Bendron jogs over to retrieve the rock, and uses his halberd to quiet the orc"
1396,Dragodar,"Bendron quickly shuffles over to the orc and slides the sharp edge of his halberd through the soft neck tissue of the dying guard. The orc lies still as blood flows from his neck and mixes with the mud. The party stands at the gate, both orcs dead on the ground nearby.Demryon: (1d20+9)23Gideon: (1d20+2)10Bendron: (1d20-1)14Chadwick: (1d20-1)7As Bendron ends the life of the last orc, you both simultaneously notice two orcs on the wall ramparts. They are between 100 and 150 feet away, and are walking along the top of the wall toward the gate. They have not yet noticed the party or the dead guards."
1397,Graehamkracker,Bendron presses his back against the gate and silently beckons the others to him.
1398,Dragodar,"The torch recently held by the deceased orc sputters and flickers on the street. In the soft glow, the rest of the party sees Bendron press tightly against the gate as if trying to stay out of sight, and beckon to them to do the same. The two dead orcs lie in the mud, one face down with his throat slit and the other on his back with an arrow protruding from his throat. The soft glow of the dying torch illuminates a small area around the gate and the bodies."
1399,Nightwing32193,"Gideon follows and spits on the bodies of the 2 slain orcs as he passes, moving as quietly as possible."
1400,RealZachKraus,"Chadwick checks the bodies for goodies. ""You never know what these scums are carrying. Ill-gotten, of course,"" he mutters."
1401,Graehamkracker,Bendron attempts to hook Chad with the halberd and pull him under the wall
1402,RealZachKraus,Chadwick is visibly irritated by the dwarf attempting to manhandle him but keeps his cool because it's a dangerous situation and a pissing contest would only draw attention to their position.
1403,Dragodar,"Chadwick, making an annoyed face, quickly finishes looting the bodies of the dead orcs. On the bodies of the dead orcs, Chadwick finds: 14 gold pieces2 shortspears 2 wooden bucklers 2 daggers 3 folded pieces of paper 1 small leather pouch with unknown contents 1 whittling knife 1 small, crusely whittled figurine of a horse<u>OoC: What does Chadwick take?"
1404,RealZachKraus,"Chadwick grabs the gold, the spears, the pouch, and the papers. As he turns to leave the wooden horse intrigues him, scowling he picks that up too, and hops under cover."
1405,Dragodar,"After a few moments of rifling through the bodies, Chadwick rushes to join the others by the gate.Spot Check: (1d20+3)16As he moves away from the bodies toward the gate, there is a shout from on top of the wall. Atop the ramparts, less than a hundred feet away, two more orcs are standing, alert and startled, as they point at Chadwick's moving form in the dim light of the sputtering torch.The two guards rush forward along the top of the wall. Before they are much closer, Chadwick is out of sight under the overhang above the gate. But the increased agitation in their shouting soon informs the party that they have seen the dead bodies in the torchlight. Although the party is currently hidden beneath the overhang, it is fairly obvious that the orcs saw Chadwick and are attempting to peer over the ramparts and get a look at the hiding spot next to the gate, all the while shouting a cry of alarm."
1406,RealZachKraus,"""Any bright ideas, boys?"" Chadwick hisses."
1407,Dragodar,"Uamm hits Demryon on the chest with urgency. ""They need to die, <i>now,"" he says."
1408,Nightwing32193,"Gideon takes a deep breath. He unbuckles his great sword and hands it to Chad, Keep an eye on her for me bud. Shouldnt be gone too long. Gideon sneaks about 20 feet down the wall from his companions and emerges from the shadows, long bow in hand. Notching am arrow he whistles towards the orcs above his friends. When he gets their attention he lets the arrow fly at the one in front. If they notice and I hit, I notch another one and let fly. If they notice and I miss I take off down the side of the wall in an attempt to lead them away from the main group. #CharacterDevelopmentBRO"
1409,BeefyChickens,"Demryon follows suit, but focuses his shot on the orc tailing the other"
1410,Nightwing32193,Gideon motions quietly for the Elf to stay put and keep quiet.

One of them raises a spear and throws it down at Gideon as the barbarian draws his bow.Guard Attack: (1d20+5)19Guard Damage: (1d6+2)6The spear strikes Gideon in the side, drawing blood. Before the spear has even struck, the other orc is already releasing his own spear at Demryon, only having seen him because of his proximity to Gideon, whose attempt at stealth was insufficient.Guard Attack: (1d20+5)14Guard Damage: (1d6+2)5But Demryon twists his body and narrowly evades the deadly projectile. Having expended their only weapons, both orcs take off running along the wall in opposite directions, one to the northeast and one back over the gate to the southwest.This is an immediate reaction scenario. Demryon and Gideon do not have time to discuss with one another which orc they will shoot at. So without consulting one another (I'm trusting y'all) use spoiler GM Only tags to tell me which orcs y'all are choosing to shoot at."
1412,BeefyChickens,Demryon quickly finds his stance and fires at the furthest  orc.
1413,Nightwing32193,Gideon picks up the spear and musters all his strength and hurls it back at the orc that threw it.

Demryon's arrow catches the orc directly in the small of the back, while Gideon's spear strikes the base of the orc's neck. The spear neatly severs the orc's spinal cord and sails completely through his neck, seemingly without losing velocity, disappearing over the other side of the wall. The orc is dead before he even begins to fall, and his limp corpse topples off the other side of the wall after the spear.By the time they turn their attention to the orc heading north, he is already almost a hundred feet away, climbing a ladder down the other side of the district wall into a different district."

1419,Graehamkracker,"""We seem better suited for that anyways"""
1420,Dragodar,"""Then let's go now,"" Uamm says, trying the gate. Like the first one, it is barred from the other side. ""No time for the rope trick this time. Lord Demryon, up,"" Uamm says with a pointed glance at the top of the wall, interlacing his fingers and squatting down to give Demryon a boost. ""Gideon, help me. We're going to have to get his feet above our heads.""To the east, in the direction which the orc fled, a third alarm bell begins to toll. LinkSpotify Link"
1421,Nightwing32193,"Gideon takes his sword back from Chadwick and buckles it hastily back on his back then positions himself next to the elf, This is where the fun begins. he says with a smile."
1422,BeefyChickens,"Demryon slaps Gideons shoulder, Awfully headstrong, but your confidence is assuring."" Demryon smirks and readys himself to scale the wall."
1423,Nightwing32193,"Gideon looks slightly bewildered at Demyron, Instead of touching me just climb the wall. Were on a clock here."

Their timing isn't perfect, and Demryon wobbles for a moment, struggling to keep his balance, but quickly recovers his equilibrium and reaches for the edge of the wall. The elf grabs the edge with his fingers and uses a few kicks of his legs to kip up and throw his elbows onto the ledge. Struggling for but a moment, he is soon able to wriggle onto the wall. Holding onto the edge on the other side, he lowers himself down and drops to the ground.A few moments later, there is a bumping sound as the bar is removed from  the other side, and the gate creaks open to reveal a very muddy Demryon."

1431,Dragodar,"The party slips through the gate one at a time, quickly replacing the bar before continuing into the marketplace district. As alarm bells ring out from the northwest, southwest, and northeast, lights begin to come on in the rooms above the shops as the residents wake up and look out curiously into the streets. The marketplace district is highly populated and will be dangerous to navigate.""We'll need to skirt around the edge of the district. No way we're making through the main thoroughfare undetected,"" Uamm says, trying to keep his voice down but projecting over the pouring rain. The market square is visible up ahead, lit by street lamps but empty for the time being.The old elf leads the way without another word, staying close to the district wall as he makes his way west, behind the buildings and away from the street lamps. Keeping behind the buildings, the party spends several agonizing minutes making quick dashes from cover to cover, avoiding light from windows and street lamps and hiding from any guards that might spot them. As they sneak through the shadows, they hear a low commotion in the market square and the marketplace alarm bell joins the three that are already tolling. As the party makes their mad dashes for cover, they can see, through the gaps in the buildings, guards assembling in the square.=============Soon enough, they are standing about eight to ten yards from the garrison district gate, taking cover behind the guardhouse. There is about twenty or thirty feet of ground between them and the gate, with no available cover or concealment. Standing by the gate are four guards, fully alert, with their weapons raised. A little fewer than a hundred feet to the party's right, the market square is brightly lit by multiple street lamps and they can now see at least ten to twelve guards milling about on patrol through the square, who were not there when they originally came through the gate into the marketplace.The alarm bells continue to chime out their alert, only adding to the tension of the situation and the party's stress.A: Your current locationB: Dozen or so guards in market squareC: Original gate you came throughD: Where the guard who escaped climbed down a ladderE: The garrisonDotted Line: Route taken from last gate to current location."

1434,Nightwing32193,Honestly? No. No I dont. But if you guys can get the elves out Im sure Chad and I can create some ruckus.

1438,Nightwing32193,"Better then standing around doing nothing I suppose. Gideon says and places his foot in the dwarfs hands, ready to be boosted."

1441,Dragodar,OoCHere marks the point in the story at which we will make the transition from 3.5 to 5e.
